### Introduction
The terms "Big Data" and "Data Science" are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct concepts with profound implications for modern software development. Big Data refers to the exponential growth of data generated from various sources, including social media, sensors, IoT devices, and more. This deluge of data requires novel approaches to processing, storing, and analyzing it efficiently.

Data Science, on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from complex data sets. It involves using various techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, and visualization, to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The interplay between Big Data and Data Science has given rise to new challenges and opportunities in software development.

Consider a real-world example: a social media platform with millions of users generating billions of interactions daily. This avalanche of data requires efficient processing and analysis to identify trends, detect anomalies, and predict user behavior. A Python-based solution using libraries like Pandas and NumPy could be employed to handle the sheer volume of data, followed by machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights.

### Detailed Explanation
#### Micro-Level Analysis

At its core, Big Data is about processing massive amounts of semi-structured or unstructured data efficiently. This involves leveraging distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark, which can scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes. For instance, consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates basic data processing using Pandas:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV file with 10 million rows
data = pd.read_csv('large_data.csv')

# Perform filtering and aggregation operations
filtered_data = data[data['column1'] > 0].groupby('column2').sum()

# Output the results to a new CSV file
filtered_data.to_csv('processed_data.csv', index=False)
```
This code snippet exemplifies the basic principles of Big Data processing: loading large datasets, filtering and aggregating data, and outputting the results.

#### Macro-Level Analysis

When considering the broader implications of Big Data vs Data Science, we must examine the architectural impact on modern software development. This includes:

* Scalability: Big Data solutions require horizontal scaling to accommodate growing data volumes.
* Performance considerations: Optimizing data processing and analysis workflows is crucial for efficient execution.
* Integration with other technologies: Seamless integration with distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark, as well as cloud-based services, is essential.

For instance, consider a hypothetical large-scale application that aggregates and analyzes IoT sensor data in real-time. This would require integrating with distributed computing frameworks to process the massive amounts of data efficiently.

### Practical Examples
#### Example 1: Small-Scale Implementation

Let's consider a small-scale implementation using Python:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV file with 100,000 rows
data = pd.read_csv('small_data.csv')

# Perform filtering and aggregation operations
filtered_data = data[data['column1'] > 0].groupby('column2').sum()

# Output the results to a new CSV file
filtered_data.to_csv('processed_data.csv', index=False)
```
This code snippet demonstrates the mechanics of Big Data processing on a smaller scale, showcasing filtering and aggregation operations.

#### Example 2: Large-Scale Application

Consider a hypothetical large-scale application that integrates with distributed computing frameworks:
```java
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;

public class BigDataExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()
                .appName("Big Data Example")
                .getOrCreate();

        // Load CSV file with 100 million rows
        Dataset<Row> data = spark.read().format("csv").load("large_data.csv");

        // Perform filtering and aggregation operations
        Dataset<Row> filtered_data = data.filter(data.col("column1") > 0)
                .groupBy(data.col("column2")).sum();

        // Output the results to a new CSV file
        filtered_data.write().format("csv").save("processed_data.csv");
    }
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates the integration of Big Data processing with distributed computing frameworks like Spark.

### Prospects and Challenges
#### Future Prospects

As data volumes continue to grow, we can expect advancements in:

* Distributed computing frameworks: Improved scalability, performance, and efficiency.
* Machine learning algorithms: Increased complexity, interpretability, and explainability.
* Data visualization tools: Enhanced interactivity, storytelling, and exploration capabilities.

#### Challenges and Mitigations

Common challenges include:

* Performance trade-offs: Balancing processing speed with memory usage and network bandwidth.
* Integration complexities: Seamlessly integrating Big Data solutions with existing systems.
* Adoption barriers: Educating users on the benefits and best practices of Big Data vs Data Science.

To mitigate these challenges, practitioners should focus on:

* Developing expertise in distributed computing frameworks and machine learning algorithms.
* Implementing robust data quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability.
* Fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing within teams.
