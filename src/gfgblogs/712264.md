Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the problem "Remove duplicates from a sorted doubly linked list":

**Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Doubly Linked List**
=====================================================

## Summary
Given a sorted doubly linked list, remove all duplicate elements while preserving the original order. This problem requires a combination of understanding linked lists and implementing an efficient algorithm to eliminate duplicates.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the linked list, comparing each node with its next node (if it exists), and removing any duplicate nodes. Since the list is sorted, we only need to check if the current node's value matches the previous node's value. If they match, remove the current node; otherwise, move on to the next node.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers: `prev` and `curr`, both pointing to the head of the list.
2. Iterate through the list using `curr`. For each node:
	* Check if `curr` is not null (i.e., we have reached the end of the list).
	* If `curr` is not null, compare its value with `prev`'s value.
	* If they match, remove `curr` from the list and move on to the next node by updating `prev` and `curr`.
3. Continue iterating until we reach the end of the list.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the two pointers.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public static Node removeDuplicates(Node head) {
    if (head == null) return null;

    Node prev = head;
    Node curr = head.next;

    while (curr != null) {
        if (prev.val == curr.val) {
            prev.next = curr.next;
            curr = curr.next;
        } else {
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
    }

    return head;
}
```

### Python
```python
def remove_duplicates(head):
    if not head: return None

    prev = head
    curr = head.next

    while curr:
        if prev.val == curr.val:
            prev.next = curr.next
            curr = curr.next
        else:
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
    return head
```

### C++
```cpp
Node* removeDuplicates(Node* head) {
    if (head == nullptr) return nullptr;

    Node* prev = head;
    Node* curr = head->next;

    while (curr != nullptr) {
        if (prev->val == curr->val) {
            prev->next = curr->next;
            curr = curr->next;
        } else {
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }

    return head;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function removeDuplicates(head) {
  if (!head) return null;

  let prev = head;
  let curr = head.next;

  while (curr) {
    if (prev.val === curr.val) {
      prev.next = curr.next;
      curr = curr.next;
    } else {
      prev = curr;
      curr = curr.next;
    }
  }

  return head;
}
```

Note: The above code assumes that the doubly linked list is represented as a class with methods for inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of your problem.
