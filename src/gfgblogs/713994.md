**Frogs and Jumps**
====================================================================

### Summary

In this problem, we are given an array of integers representing the positions of frogs on a log. Each frog can jump at most `k` units to the right or left. Our task is to find the maximum number of consecutive jumps each frog can make. This problem involves arrays and dynamic programming.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and for each position, calculate the maximum number of consecutive jumps that a frog at that position can make. We use a variable `maxJumps` to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive jumps. For each position, we update `maxJumps` based on the positions that are within the jump distance (`k`) from the current position.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `maxJumps` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (since the first element can only make one jump).
3. For each position, calculate the maximum number of consecutive jumps that a frog at that position can make by considering the positions within the jump distance (`k`) to the left and right.
4. Update `maxJumps` based on the calculation in step 3.
5. Return the maximum value of `maxJumps`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int maxConsecutiveJumps(int[] frogs, int k) {
    int maxJumps = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < frogs.length; i++) {
        int jumps = 0;
        for (int j = Math.max(0, i - k); j <= Math.min(frogs.length - 1, i + k); j++) {
            if (Math.abs(i - j) > k) break;
            jumps++;
        }
        maxJumps = Math.max(maxJumps, jumps);
    }
    return maxJumps;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def max_consecutive_jumps(frogs, k):
    max_jumps = 0
    for i in range(1, len(frogs)):
        jumps = 0
        for j in range(max(0, i - k), min(len(frogs) - 1, i + k) + 1):
            if abs(i - j) > k:
                break
            jumps += 1
        max_jumps = max(max_jumps, jumps)
    return max_jumps
```

#### C++
```cpp
int maxConsecutiveJumps(int frogs[], int n, int k) {
    int maxJumps = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int jumps = 0;
        for (int j = std::max(0, i - k); j <= std::min(n - 1, i + k); j++) {
            if (std::abs(i - j) > k) break;
            jumps++;
        }
        maxJumps = std::max(maxJumps, jumps);
    }
    return maxJumps;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxConsecutiveJumps(frogs, k) {
  let maxJumps = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < frogs.length; i++) {
    let jumps = 0;
    for (let j = Math.max(0, i - k); j <= Math.min(frogs.length - 1, i + k); j++) {
      if (Math.abs(i - j) > k) break;
      jumps++;
    }
    maxJumps = Math.max(maxJumps, jumps);
  }
  return maxJumps;
}
```
