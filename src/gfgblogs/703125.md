**Tiger Zinda Hai: Find the number of tabs opened**
=============================================

## Summary
In this problem, we are asked to find the total number of tabs opened in a system. Given an array of strings where each string represents a tab opening or closing operation (e.g., "Open" or "Close"), our task is to count the total number of tabs opened. This problem involves arrays and hash data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to this problem is simple yet effective. We iterate through the array of operations, keeping track of the current number of open tabs using a variable `open_tabs`. Whenever we encounter an "Open" operation, we increment `open_tabs`, and whenever we encounter a "Close" operation, we decrement it. The final value of `open_tabs` will represent the total number of tabs opened.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. Initialize a variable `open_tabs` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array of operations.
3. For each operation, check if it's an "Open" or "Close" operation.
4. If it's an "Open" operation, increment `open_tabs`.
5. If it's a "Close" operation and `open_tabs` is greater than 0, decrement `open_tabs`. This ensures that we don't go below 0 (i.e., negative tabs).
6. Return the final value of `open_tabs`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of operations.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `open_tabs` variable.

## Optimized Solutions
Here are optimized solutions in various programming languages:

### Java
```java
public int countOpenTabs(String[] operations) {
    int open_tabs = 0;
    for (String operation : operations) {
        if (operation.equals("Open")) {
            open_tabs++;
        } else if (open_tabs > 0 && operation.equals("Close")) {
            open_tabs--;
        }
    }
    return open_tabs;
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_open_tabs(operations):
    open_tabs = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == "Open":
            open_tabs += 1
        elif open_tabs > 0 and operation == "Close":
            open_tabs -= 1
    return open_tabs
```

### C++
```cpp
int countOpenTabs(const std::string* operations, int n) {
    int open_tabs = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (operations[i] == "Open") {
            open_tabs++;
        } else if (open_tabs > 0 && operations[i] == "Close") {
            open_tabs--;
        }
    }
    return open_tabs;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countOpenTabs(operations) {
    let open_tabs = 0;
    for (let operation of operations) {
        if (operation === "Open") {
            open_tabs++;
        } else if (open_tabs > 0 && operation === "Close") {
            open_tabs--;
        }
    }
    return open_tabs;
}
```

These solutions all have the same time and space complexity: O(n) and O(1), respectively.
