**Regular Polygon-1**
=====================

## Summary
The problem involves creating a regular polygon with n sides, where each side has an equal length. The key concepts involved are arrays and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
To create a regular polygon, we need to calculate the length of each side based on the number of sides (n) and the radius of the circumscribed circle. We can use the formula: `side_length = 2 * math.pi * radius / n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Calculate the circumference of the circumscribed circle using the formula `circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius`.
2. Divide the circumference by the number of sides (n) to get the length of each side: `side_length = circumference / n`.
3. Return the calculated side length.

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

Here's an ASCII art diagram representing a regular polygon with 5 sides:

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class RegularPolygon {
    public static double calculateSideLength(int n, double radius) {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius / n;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class RegularPolygon:
    def calculate_side_length(self, n, radius):
        return 2 * math.pi * radius / n
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <cmath>

double calculateSideLength(int n, double radius) {
    return 2 * M_PI * radius / n;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function calculateSideLength(n, radius) {
    return 2 * Math.PI * radius / n;
}
```

Note: The above solutions are based on the assumption that the input values (n and radius) are valid and non-negative. In a real-world implementation, you would need to add error handling for invalid inputs.
