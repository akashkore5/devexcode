**Minimum sum of two elements from two arrays**
=====================================================

## Summary
Given two arrays, find the minimum sum of two elements, one from each array. This problem requires understanding of basic algorithmic concepts and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through both arrays simultaneously and calculating the sum of each pair. The smallest sum is then returned as the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize variables `min_sum` to store the minimum sum, and `sum` to calculate the current sum.
2. Iterate through both arrays using two pointers, `i` for array 1 and `j` for array 2.
3. For each pair of elements, calculate the sum by adding the corresponding elements from both arrays (e.g., `arr1[i] + arr2[j]`).
4. Compare the current sum with the minimum sum found so far (`min_sum`). If the current sum is smaller, update `min_sum`.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all pairs of elements have been considered.
6. Return the minimum sum as the result.

Time complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are the sizes of the two arrays.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store `min_sum` and intermediate variables.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static int minSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int min_sum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
                int sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j];
                if (sum < min_sum) {
                    min_sum = sum;
                }
            }
        }
        return min_sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {1, 3, 5};
        int[] arr2 = {2, 4, 6};
        System.out.println(minSum(arr1, arr2));
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_sum(arr1, arr2):
    min_sum = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        for j in range(len(arr2)):
            sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j]
            if sum < min_sum:
                min_sum = sum
    return min_sum

print(min_sum([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]))
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minSum(std::vector<int> arr1, std::vector<int> arr2) {
    int min_sum = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr1.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr2.size(); j++) {
            int sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j];
            if (sum < min_sum) {
                min_sum = sum;
            }
        }
    }
    return min_sum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {1, 3, 5};
    std::vector<int> arr2 = {2, 4, 6};
    std::cout << minSum(arr1, arr2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minSum(arr1, arr2) {
    let min_sum = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j];
            if (sum < min_sum) {
                min_sum = sum;
            }
        }
    }
    return min_sum;
}

console.log(minSum([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]));
```
