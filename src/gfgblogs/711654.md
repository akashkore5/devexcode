## Summary
This problem involves printing a triangular number pattern. The pattern starts with 1, then each subsequent row is one more than the previous row's sum. For example, the first three rows are 1, 2+1=3, and 4+3+1=8. We need to write an algorithm that prints this pattern up to a given number of rows.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by using a simple loop to generate the triangular numbers. The key concept involved is understanding how triangular numbers are calculated. A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `row` to 1, which will be the first row.
2. Start a loop that runs up to the given number of rows.
3. Inside the loop, calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to `row`. This is the formula for triangular numbers: `n*(n+1)/2`, where `n` is the current row.
4. Print the calculated sum as the current row.
5. Increment `row` by 1 and repeat steps 3-4 until the loop ends.

Here's a diagram of how the pattern looks like:

```
    1
   2 1
  3 2 1
 4 3 2 1
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of rows. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int rows = 5; // Number of rows
        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                sum += j;
            }
            System.out.println(sum);
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def print_triangle(rows):
    for i in range(1, rows+1):
        sum = sum(range(1, i+1))
        print(sum)

print_triangle(5)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int rows = 5; // Number of rows
    for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            sum += j;
        }
        std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function printTriangle(rows) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            sum += j;
        }
        console.log(sum);
    }
}

printTriangle(5);
```

Note that these optimized solutions are just one way to solve the problem, and there may be other approaches as well.
