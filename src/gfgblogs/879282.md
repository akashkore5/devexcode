**Print ascii value in python**
======================================================

## Summary
The problem requires printing ASCII values for a given input string. The key concept involved is the use of ASCII codes, which represent characters as unique numerical values.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string and print its corresponding ASCII value. We can do this by using Python's built-in `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code point for a given character.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty string to store the output.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. For each character, use the `ord()` function to get its ASCII value.
4. Append the ASCII value as a string to the output string.
5. Print the final output string.

Here is the time and space complexity analysis:

* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
* Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the output string.

## Optimized Solutions
### Python
```
python
def print_ascii(input_string):
    output = ""
    for char in input_string:
        output += str(ord(char)) + " "
    print(output)

# Test the function
input_string = "Hello World"
print_ascii(input_string)
```
