**Switch Statement**
======================================================

### Summary
The problem is about implementing a switch statement in different programming languages. The goal is to demonstrate how to use a switch statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

### Detailed Explanation
A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on the value of an expression. It's similar to if-else statements, but it provides more readability and maintainability. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement a switch statement:

1.  Define the variable or expression that you want to use as the condition for your switch statement.
2.  Use the `switch` keyword followed by the name of your variable or expression in parentheses.
3.  Inside the switch block, define each case using the `case` keyword followed by a constant value.
4.  For each case, specify what code you want to execute when that case is matched.
5.  If there's a default case, use the `default` keyword.

Here's an example of how this would work:
```
int x = 2;
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("X is 1");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("X is 2");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("X is neither 1 nor 2");
}
```
This code would print "X is 2" because the value of `x` is 2.

### Optimized Solutions
Here are some optimized solutions in different programming languages:

#### Java
```java
int x = 2;
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("X is 1");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("X is 2");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("X is neither 1 nor 2");
}
```

#### Python
```python
x = 2
if x == 1:
    print("X is 1")
elif x == 2:
    print("X is 2")
else:
    print("X is neither 1 nor 2")
```

#### C++
```cpp
int x = 2;
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        cout << "X is 1" << endl;
        break;
    case 2:
        cout << "X is 2" << endl;
        break;
    default:
        cout << "X is neither 1 nor 2" << endl;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
let x = 2;
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        console.log("X is 1");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("X is 2");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("X is neither 1 nor 2");
}
```
