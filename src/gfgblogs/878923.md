**Fibonacci Number**
================================

## Summary
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This problem involves calculating a given `n`th Fibonacci number.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the nth Fibonacci number. We can start by considering a recursive approach:

* The base cases are F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
* For n > 1, F(n) is the sum of F(n-1) and F(n-2).

However, this recursive approach has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations. To optimize this, we can use dynamic programming by storing the Fibonacci numbers as we calculate them:

* Create an array `fib` of size n+1 and initialize it with 0s.
* Set `fib[0] = 0` and `fib[1] = 1`.
* For i from 2 to n, set `fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]`.

This dynamic programming approach has linear time complexity O(n), which is much more efficient.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Create an array `fib` of size n+1 and initialize it with 0s.
2. Set `fib[0] = 0` and `fib[1] = 1`.
3. For i from 2 to n, set `fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]`.
4. Return `fib[n]`, which is the nth Fibonacci number.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] fib = new int[n+1];
    fib[0] = 0; fib[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
    }
    return fib[n];
}
```

### Python
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    fib = [0]*(n+1)
    fib[0], fib[1] = 0, 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
    return fib[n]
```

### C++
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int fib[n+1];
    fib[0] = 0; fib[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
    }
    return fib[n];
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    let fib = new Array(n+1).fill(0);
    fib[0] = 0; fib[1] = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
    }
    return fib[n];
}
```
