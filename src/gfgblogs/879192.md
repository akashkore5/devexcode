**The Elif Statement**

## Summary
The problem is about using the `elif` statement in Python, which allows you to specify additional conditions if the initial condition fails. The key concept involved is conditional statements and their usage.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use the `elif` statement in a simple program. The `elif` statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check and you want to execute different blocks of code based on those conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Define a variable that takes user input.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if the input is greater than 0.
3. If the condition fails, use `elif` to check if the input is less than or equal to 0.
4. If the input is within the range [0, 1), execute a specific block of code.
5. If the input is outside this range, execute another specific block of code.

Here's an example:
```
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if x > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif x <= 0:
    if x == 0:
        print("The number is zero.")
    else:
        print("The number is negative or zero.")
```

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();

        if (x > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else if (x <= 0) {
            if (x == 0) {
                System.out.println("The number is zero.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("The number is negative or zero.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if x > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif x <= 0:
    if x == 0:
        print("The number is zero.")
    else:
        print("The number is negative or zero.")
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> x;

    if (x > 0) {
        cout << "The number is positive.";
    } else if (x <= 0) {
        if (x == 0) {
            cout << "The number is zero.";
        } else {
            cout << "The number is negative or zero.";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
let x = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));

if (x > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive.");
} else if (x <= 0) {
    if (x == 0) {
        console.log("The number is zero.");
    } else {
        console.log("The number is negative or zero.");
    }
}
```

Note: The code for each language includes the same functionality as the Python code, with slight variations in syntax and structure.
