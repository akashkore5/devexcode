## Summary
The problem involves printing the adjacency list representation of a given graph. The key concepts involved are graph theory and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
To print the adjacency list of a graph, we first need to understand what an adjacency list is. It is a representation of a graph where each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes. In other words, for each node, we store all its adjacent nodes.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start by initializing an empty dictionary (or map) to represent the adjacency list.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. For each node, iterate through its neighboring nodes and add them to the adjacency list.
4. Finally, print out the adjacency list.

Here's a sample output for an adjacency list of a graph with three nodes A, B, C:

```
A -> [B]
B -> [C, A]
C -> []
```

In this representation, each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes. Time complexity for printing the adjacency list is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

Space complexity is also O(V + E) as we need to store all the vertices and edges in the adjacency list.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void printAdjacencyList(int[][] graph) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjacencyList = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            adjacencyList.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
            for (int j = 0; j < graph[i].length; j++) {
                if (graph[i][j] == 1) {
                    adjacencyList.get(i).add(j);
                }
            }
        }
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, List<Integer>> entry : adjacencyList.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " -> " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] graph = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 0}};
        printAdjacencyList(graph);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def print_adjacency_list(graph):
    adjacency_list = {}
    for i in range(len(graph)):
        adjacency_list[i] = []
        for j in range(len(graph[i])):
            if graph[i][j] == 1:
                adjacency_list[i].append(j)
    for node, neighbors in adjacency_list.items():
        print(f"{node} -> {neighbors}")

graph = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
print_adjacency_list(graph)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

void printAdjacencyList(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& graph) {
    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> adjacencyList;
    for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
        adjacencyList[i] = {};
        for (int j = 0; j < graph[i].size(); j++) {
            if (graph[i][j] == 1) {
                adjacencyList[i].push_back(j);
            }
        }
    }
    for (const auto& entry : adjacencyList) {
        std::cout << entry.first << " -> ";
        for (int neighbor : entry.second) {
            std::cout << neighbor << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 0}};
    printAdjacencyList(graph);
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function printAdjacencyList(graph) {
    let adjacencyList = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
        adjacencyList[i] = [];
        for (let j = 0; j < graph[i].length; j++) {
            if (graph[i][j] === 1) {
                adjacencyList[i].push(j);
            }
        }
    }
    for (const [node, neighbors] of Object.entries(adjacencyList)) {
        console.log(`${node} -> ${neighbors}`);
    }
}

let graph = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]];
printAdjacencyList(graph);
```

This is a simple problem that requires understanding of graph data structures and algorithms.
