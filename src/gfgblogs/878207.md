# Find H-Index for sorted citations
## Summary
The H-Index is a metric used to measure the productivity and citation impact of the publication of a scholar. Given a list of integers representing the number of citations for each of a researcher's papers, find the maximum value of h such that the first h papers are cited at least h times.

This problem involves working with arrays, which require attention to detail and efficient algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
The given array represents the number of citations for each paper. The goal is to find the H-Index, which is the largest possible integer `h` such that the sum of the first `h` elements is greater than or equal to `h`. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize variables: Set `h = 0`, `i = 0` (index), and `sum = 0`.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - For each element, increment `i` by 1.
   - Add the current element to `sum`. 
   - If `sum >= i`, update `h` to `i` and reset `sum` to 0.
3. Return `h` as the H-Index.

The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the size of the array, because we're iterating through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int findHIndex(int[] citations) {
    int h = 0;
    int i = 0;
    int sum = 0;

    for (int citation : citations) {
        i++;
        sum += citation;
        if (sum >= i) {
            h = i;
            sum = 0;
        }
    }

    return h;
}
```
### Python
```python
def find_h_index(citations):
    h = 0
    i = 0
    sum = 0

    for citation in citations:
        i += 1
        sum += citation
        if sum >= i:
            h = i
            sum = 0

    return h
```
### C++
```cpp
int findHIndex(int* citations, int n) {
    int h = 0;
    int i = 0;
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += citations[i];
        if (sum >= i + 1) {
            h = i + 1;
            sum = 0;
        }
    }

    return h;
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function findHIndex(citations) {
    let h = 0;
    let i = 0;
    let sum = 0;

    for (let citation of citations) {
        i++;
        sum += citation;
        if (sum >= i) {
            h = i;
            sum = 0;
        }
    }

    return h;
}
```
Note: The above solutions assume that the input array `citations` is already sorted in descending order. If it's not, you would need to sort it first before solving the problem.
