# Inheritance in Java
## Summary
This problem is about understanding and implementing inheritance in Java. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.

## Detailed Explanation
In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword. When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it automatically inherits all the fields and methods of the superclass. The subclass can also add new fields and methods or override the ones inherited from the superclass.
Here's an example step-by-step breakdown of how to implement inheritance in Java:

1. Define a superclass (also known as the parent class) with its own fields and methods:
```java
public class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}
```
2. Create a subclass that inherits from the superclass using the `extends` keyword:
```java
public class Dog extends Animal {
    // Add new fields or override inherited methods as needed
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Dog` class inherits the `sound()` method from the `Animal` class and overrides it with its own implementation.

3. Create an instance of the subclass and call its methods:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound(); // Output: The dog barks.
    }
}
```
In this example, we create an instance of the `Dog` class and call its `sound()` method. Since the `Dog` class overrides the inherited `sound()` method from the `Animal` class, it outputs "The dog barks." instead of "The animal makes a sound."

Time complexity: O(1) since inheritance is a one-time operation.
Space complexity: O(1) since no additional space is required.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("The animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("The dog barks.")
```
### C++
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void sound() {
        std::cout << "The animal makes a sound." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() {
        std::cout << "The dog barks." << std::endl;
    }
};
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
class Animal {
  sound() {
    console.log("The animal makes a sound.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  sound() {
    console.log("The dog barks.");
  }
}
```
Note that the above solutions are simplified and do not include error handling or additional features.
