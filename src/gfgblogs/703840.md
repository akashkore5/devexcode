### Summary

Given an array of integers, rearrange it such that all elements are in ascending order. This problem is related to arrays and data structures.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we will first sort the given array in ascending order. We can use a simple sorting algorithm like bubble sort or insertion sort for this purpose. Once the array is sorted, we can print it as the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Read the input array.
2. Sort the array in ascending order using a suitable sorting algorithm.
3. Print the sorted array.

The time complexity of this solution will be O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity will be O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class RearrangeArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {4, 2, 9, 6, 23, 12, 34, 0, 1};
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
arr = [4, 2, 9, 6, 23, 12, 34, 0, 1]
arr.sort()
print(arr)
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {4, 2, 9, 6, 23, 12, 34, 0, 1};
    std::sort(arr, arr + sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]));
    for (int i : arr) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
let arr = [4, 2, 9, 6, 23, 12, 34, 0, 1];
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(arr);
```
Note: These optimized solutions are written in the respective languages and use built-in sorting functions to solve the problem efficiently.
