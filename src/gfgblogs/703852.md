## Summary
The "Ceil The Floor" problem involves finding the ceiling of all elements in an array. In other words, we need to find the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to each element in the array.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and for each element, calculate its ceiling by adding 1 until we get a value that is not less than the current element. We then return an array of these ceilings as the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty array `ceilings` to store the ceilings of all elements in the input array.
2. Iterate through each element `x` in the input array.
3. For each element, calculate its ceiling by initializing a variable `ceiling` to `x`.
4. Increment `ceiling` until it is greater than or equal to `x`. This can be done using a simple loop that adds 1 to `ceiling` until the condition is met.
5. Append the calculated ceiling to the `ceilings` array.
6. Return the `ceilings` array as the result.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the process:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Input Array: [3, 1, 4]  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  v
+-----------------------+
|  Ceiling Calculation:   |
|  For each element x,    |
|  Calculate ceiling(x)   |
|  until ceiling >= x    |
|  Append ceiling to array|
+-----------------------+
                  |
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Ceilings Array: [4, 2, 5] |
          +---------------+
```
Time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. Space complexity is also O(n) because we need to store the ceilings in an array.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int[] ceilTheFloor(int[] arr) {
    int[] ceilings = new int[arr.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int ceiling = arr[i];
        while (ceiling <= arr[i]) {
            ceiling++;
        }
        ceilings[i] = ceiling;
    }
    return ceilings;
}
```

### Python
```python
def ceil_the_floor(arr):
    ceilings = [x for x in arr]
    for i, x in enumerate(ceilings):
        while x <= arr[i]:
            x += 1
    return ceilings
```

### C++
```cpp
int* ceilTheFloor(int* arr, int n) {
    int* ceilings = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int ceiling = arr[i];
        while (ceiling <= arr[i]) {
            ceiling++;
        }
        ceilings[i] = ceiling;
    }
    return ceilings;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function ceilTheFloor(arr) {
    let ceilings = [...arr];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let ceiling = arr[i];
        while (ceiling <= arr[i]) {
            ceiling++;
        }
        ceilings[i] = ceiling;
    }
    return ceilings;
}
```
