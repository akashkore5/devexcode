# Factorial Zero Count

### Summary
Given an integer `n`, find the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of `n`. For example, for `n = 5`, the result is `2` because `5! = 120`, which has two trailing zeros.

This problem involves basic arithmetic operations and factorial calculations. The key concept is understanding how to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to understand that trailing zeros are formed by pairs of factors of `2` and `5`. This means we only need to count the factors of `5` because there will always be more factors of `2` than `5`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the number of trailing zeros.
2. Iterate from `2` to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration:
   - If `i` is divisible by `5`, increment `count`. This is because every time we encounter a factor of `5`, we get a trailing zero.
   - If `i` is also divisible by `25`, increment `count` again. This is because every time we encounter a factor of `25`, we get an additional trailing zero (since there will be more factors of `2` to pair with the `5`s).
   - Continue this process until `i > n`.
3. Return the value of `count`.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), as we need to iterate from `2` to `n`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int factorialZeroCount(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i <= n; i += 5) {
        while (i % 25 == 0) {
            count++;
            i /= 25;
        }
        while (i % 5 == 0) {
            count++;
            i /= 5;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def factorial_zero_count(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(5, n + 1, 5):
        while i % 25 == 0:
            count += 1
            i //= 25
        while i % 5 == 0:
            count += 1
            i //= 5
    return count
```

#### C++
```cpp
int factorialZeroCount(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i <= n; i += 5) {
        while (i % 25 == 0) {
            count++;
            i /= 25;
        }
        while (i % 5 == 0) {
            count++;
            i /= 5;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function factorialZeroCount(n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 5; i <= n; i += 5) {
        while (i % 25 === 0) {
            count++;
            i /= 25;
        }
        while (i % 5 === 0) {
            count++;
            i /= 5;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

These solutions all have the same time and space complexity: O(n) time and O(1) space.
