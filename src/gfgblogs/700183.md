**Decimal Equivalent of Binary Linked List**
=============================

### Summary
This problem involves converting a binary linked list to its decimal equivalent. The key concept involved is manipulation of linked lists, specifically traversing and processing nodes in a specific order.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start by defining the structure of our linked list node. Each node will have an integer value and a reference to the next node in the list.

We'll begin by initializing a variable `decimal_equivalent` to store the decimal equivalent of the binary linked list. Then, we'll traverse the linked list and add each node's value to `decimal_equivalent`, shifting the bits one position to the left for each new addition.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `decimal_equivalent` to 0.
2. Traverse the linked list:
	* For each node, check if its value is 1 (binary) or 0 (not binary).
	* If the value is 1, add 2 raised to the power of the current position (`2^i`) to `decimal_equivalent`, where `i` is the position of the node in the list.
3. Return `decimal_equivalent`.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we're traversing the list once. The space complexity is O(1), as we're not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int decimalEquivalent(BinaryNode head) {
    int decimal_equivalent = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (head != null) {
        if (head.value == 1) {
            decimal_equivalent += (int) Math.pow(2, i);
        }
        head = head.next;
        i++;
    }
    return decimal_equivalent;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def decimal_equivalent(head):
    decimal_equivalent = 0
    i = 0
    while head:
        if head.value == 1:
            decimal_equivalent += 2 ** i
        head = head.next
        i += 1
    return decimal_equivalent
```

#### C++
```cpp
int decimalEquivalent(struct BinaryNode* head) {
    int decimal_equivalent = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (head != NULL) {
        if (head->value == 1)
            decimal_equivalent += pow(2, i);
        head = head->next;
        i++;
    }
    return decimal_equivalent;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function decimalEquivalent(head) {
    let decimal_equivalent = 0;
    let i = 0;
    while (head) {
        if (head.value === 1)
            decimal_equivalent += Math.pow(2, i);
        head = head.next;
        i++;
    }
    return decimal_equivalent;
}
```
