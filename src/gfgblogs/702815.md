# Minimize the sum of product

## Summary
We are given an array `arr` and two integers `n` and `m`. We need to find the minimum sum of products that we can get by choosing `n` elements from the array, each of which will be multiplied by some integer. The goal is to minimize this sum.

The key concepts involved in this problem are arrays, greedy, sorting, data structures, and algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we first sort the array in ascending order. Then, we initialize two variables `min_sum` and `max_product`. We iterate over the array from left to right, considering each element as a candidate for multiplication. For each element, we calculate its product with the next `n-1` elements (since we need to choose `n` elements in total). We keep track of the maximum product found so far (`max_product`) and the minimum sum that can be achieved using this product (`min_sum`). The minimum sum is updated if the current sum is less than `min_sum`. Finally, we return `min_sum`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Initialize `min_sum` and `max_product`.
3. Iterate over the array from left to right:
   - For each element, calculate its product with the next `n-1` elements.
   - Update `max_product` if the current product is greater than `max_product`.
   - Calculate the sum of products using `max_product`.
   - Update `min_sum` if the current sum is less than `min_sum`.
4. Return `min_sum`.

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.
Space complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int minimizeSumOfProduct(int[] arr, int n, int m) {
    Arrays.sort(arr);
    int min_sum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - n + 1; i++) {
        int max_product = 1;
        for (int j = i; j < i + n; j++) {
            max_product *= arr[j];
        }
        min_sum = Math.min(min_sum, max_product * (arr[i + n - 1] - arr[i]));
    }
    return min_sum;
}
```

### Python
```python
def minimize_sum_of_product(arr, n, m):
    arr.sort()
    min_sum = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - n + 1):
        max_product = 1
        for j in range(i, i + n):
            max_product *= arr[j]
        min_sum = min(min_sum, max_product * (arr[i + n - 1] - arr[i]))
    return min_sum
```

### C++
```cpp
int minimizeSumOfProduct(int* arr, int n, int m) {
    sort(arr, arr + m);
    int min_sum = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < m - n + 1; i++) {
        int max_product = 1;
        for (int j = i; j < i + n; j++) {
            max_product *= arr[j];
        }
        min_sum = min(min_sum, max_product * (arr[i + n - 1] - arr[i]));
    }
    return min_sum;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minimizeSumOfProduct(arr, n, m) {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let min_sum = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - n + 1; i++) {
        let max_product = 1;
        for (let j = i; j < i + n; j++) {
            max_product *= arr[j];
        }
        min_sum = Math.min(min_sum, max_product * (arr[i + n - 1] - arr[i]));
    }
    return min_sum;
}
