**Face off Tournament**
======================================================

## Summary
In this problem, we are given a list of players and their corresponding points. We need to simulate a face-off tournament where each player plays against every other player once. The winner of each match gets 1 point, and the loser gets 0 points. Our goal is to find the total number of matches played in the tournament.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to solve this problem is quite straightforward. We need to simulate all possible matches between players and keep track of the total number of matches. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `total_matches` to 0.
2. Iterate through each player in the list.
3. For each player, iterate through every other player (excluding themselves).
4. Simulate a match between these two players and increment `total_matches` by 1 for each match.
5. Return `total_matches`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram to illustrate this approach:
```
  +---------------+
  |   Player A    |
  +---------------+
         |
         |
  +---------------+
  |   Player B    |
  +---------------+
          ...
```
In this diagram, each player is represented by a box. The arrows represent the matches between players.

Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of players.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with input size.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```
java
public int totalMatches(int[][] points) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            total++;
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```
### Python
```
python
def total_matches(points):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(points)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            total += 1
    return total
```
### C++
```
cpp
int totalMatches(int **points, int n) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            total++;
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```
### JavaScript
```
javascript
function totalMatches(points) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            total++;
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```
