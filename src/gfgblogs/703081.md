**Word with maximum frequency**
==========================

### Summary
Given an array of words, find the word with the maximum frequency. The frequency of each word is calculated by counting its occurrences in the given array.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to solve this problem involves using a HashMap (or any other data structure that supports constant-time lookups) to store the frequency of each word in the array. Then, we iterate over the map and find the word with the maximum frequency.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty HashMap `wordFrequency`.
2. Iterate over the given array of words.
3. For each word, check if it already exists in `wordFrequency`. If not, add it to the map with a frequency count of 1. If it does exist, increment its frequency by 1.
4. Once all words have been processed, iterate over `wordFrequency` and find the word with the maximum frequency.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of words in the array.

Space complexity: O(n), as we need to store the frequency count for each unique word.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static String wordWithMaxFrequency(String[] words) {
        Map<String, Integer> wordFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        String maxFrequencyWord = "";

        for (String word : words) {
            wordFrequency.put(word, wordFrequency.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
            if (wordFrequency.get(word) > maxFrequency) {
                maxFrequency = wordFrequency.get(word);
                maxFrequencyWord = word;
            }
        }

        return maxFrequencyWord;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def word_with_max_frequency(words):
    word_frequency = {}
    max_frequency = 0
    max_frequency_word = ""

    for word in words:
        word_frequency[word] = word_frequency.get(word, 0) + 1
        if word_frequency[word] > max_frequency:
            max_frequency = word_frequency[word]
            max_frequency_word = word

    return max_frequency_word
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>

std::string wordWithMaxFrequency(std::vector<std::string> words) {
    std::map<std::string, int> wordFrequency;
    int maxFrequency = 0;
    std::string maxFrequencyWord = "";

    for (const auto& word : words) {
        wordFrequency[word] += (wordFrequency.find(word) == wordFrequency.end()) ? 1 : 1 + wordFrequency[word];
        if (wordFrequency[word] > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = wordFrequency[word];
            maxFrequencyWord = word;
        }
    }

    return maxFrequencyWord;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function wordWithMaxFrequency(words) {
    let wordFrequency = {};
    let maxFrequency = 0;
    let maxFrequencyWord = "";

    for (const word of words) {
        wordFrequency[word] = (wordFrequency[word] || 0) + 1;
        if (wordFrequency[word] > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = wordFrequency[word];
            maxFrequencyWord = word;
        }
    }

    return maxFrequencyWord;
}
```
