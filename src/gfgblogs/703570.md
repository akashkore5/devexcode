## Summary
The problem is about finding all intervals in a given array of integers that are not present in the original sequence. The input array contains unique integers, and we need to find the missing intervals between these numbers.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sorted array and keep track of the previous number. For each element, we calculate the difference between the current number and the previous one, which represents the size of the interval. If the current number is not equal to the previous number plus the interval size, it means that there was a missing interval.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Sort the input array in ascending order.
2. Initialize variables `prev` and `interval_size` to the first element of the array and 0, respectively.
3. Iterate through the sorted array:
	* For each element `curr`, calculate `interval_size` as the difference between `curr` and `prev`.
	* If `curr` is not equal to `prev + interval_size`, it means that there was a missing interval.
	* Print or store this missing interval (i.e., the range from `prev + 1` to `curr - 1`).
4. Update `prev` to `curr`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the previous element and interval size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```
java
public class MissingIntervals {
    public static void findMissingIntervals(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int prev = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int curr = arr[i];
            int intervalSize = curr - prev;
            if (curr != prev + intervalSize) {
                System.out.println("Missing interval: [" + (prev + 1) + ", " + (curr - 1) + "]");
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
public class MissingIntervals:
    def find_missing_intervals(self, arr):
        arr.sort()
        prev = arr[0]
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            curr = arr[i]
            interval_size = curr - prev
            if curr != prev + interval_size:
                print("Missing interval: [{} , {} ]".format(prev + 1, curr - 1))
            prev = curr
```

### C++
```cpp
public class MissingIntervals {
    public static void findMissingIntervals(int arr[], int n) {
        sort(arr, arr+n);
        int prev = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int curr = arr[i];
            int intervalSize = curr - prev;
            if (curr != prev + intervalSize) {
                cout << "Missing interval: [" << (prev + 1) << ", " << (curr - 1) << "]" << endl;
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
    }
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class MissingIntervals {
    findMissingIntervals(arr) {
        arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        let prev = arr[0];
        for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            let curr = arr[i];
            let intervalSize = curr - prev;
            if (curr !== prev + intervalSize) {
                console.log(`Missing interval: [${prev + 1}, ${curr - 1}]`);
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
    }
}
```
