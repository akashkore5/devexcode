## Summary
The Binary Modulo problem is an easy-level mathematical problem that requires you to find the remainder of a large number when divided by another number. The key concept involved here is bit manipulation, which helps in solving this problem efficiently.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use bit manipulation techniques. Given two numbers `n` and `m`, our task is to find the remainder of `n` when divided by `m`. We can do this by using bitwise operators. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  Calculate the number of bits required to represent `m`.
2.  Use bitwise AND operation (`&`) to get the least significant bit (LSB) of `m`. This is because we are interested in finding the remainder at the LSB level.
3.  If the LSB of `m` is 1, then the remainder will be equal to `n & m`.
4.  If the LSB of `m` is 0, then the remainder will be equal to `n`.

Here's an example:

Let `n = 17` and `m = 5`. The binary representation of these numbers are `10101` (17) and `0101` (5).

To find the remainder, we need to perform bitwise AND operation (`&`) between `n` and `m`, which gives us `00001`.

So, the remainder is `1`.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static int binaryModulo(int n, int m) {
        return n & m;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 17;
        int m = 5;
        System.out.println("The remainder is: " + binaryModulo(n, m));
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def binary_modulo(n, m):
    return n & m

n = 17
m = 5
print(f"The remainder is: {binary_modulo(n, m)}")
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int binaryModulo(int n, int m) {
    return n & m;
}

int main() {
    int n = 17;
    int m = 5;
    cout << "The remainder is: " << binaryModulo(n, m) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function binaryModulo(n, m) {
    return n & m;
}

let n = 17;
let m = 5;
console.log(`The remainder is: ${binaryModulo(n, m)}`);
```

Note that the solutions are provided in different programming languages for ease of understanding. The core idea remains the same across all languages: using bitwise operations to find the remainder.
