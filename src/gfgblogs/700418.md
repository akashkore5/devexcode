# Count Occurrence of digit k

### Summary
This problem is about counting the occurrence of a given digit `k` in all numbers from 1 to `n`. The key concept involved here is arrays.

### Detailed Explanation
The approach to this problem is quite straightforward. We iterate through each number from 1 to `n`, convert it to a string, and then count the occurrences of the digit `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the occurrence of the digit `k`.
2. Iterate through each number from 1 to `n`. For each number:
    - Convert it to a string.
    - Iterate through each character in the string (which represents a digit).
    - If the current character is equal to the given digit `k`, increment the `count` variable.
3. Return the final value of `count`.

Time complexity for this problem is O(n*m) where n is the range from 1 to `n` and m is the maximum number of digits in a number.

Space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with input size.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int countOccurrence(int n, char k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        String str = Integer.toString(i);
        for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def count_occurrence(n, k):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        str_i = str(i)
        for c in str_i:
            if c == k:
                count += 1
    return count
```

#### C++
```cpp
int countOccurrence(int n, char k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        string str = to_string(i);
        for (char c : str) {
            if (c == k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function countOccurrence(n, k) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let str = i.toString();
        for (let c of str) {
            if (c === k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
