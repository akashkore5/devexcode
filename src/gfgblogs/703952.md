## Summary
Given a list of tasks with their priorities and deadlines, your task is to complete the tasks in the correct order. The priority of each task is its deadline (the earlier the better). You have to sort the tasks based on their deadlines and then start executing them from the earliest deadline.

## Detailed Explanation

The problem involves sorting an array of tasks based on their deadlines and then executing them in that order. We can use a simple sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort to achieve this.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. First, we create an empty list `tasks` to store the tasks.
2. Then, for each task in the given array, we add it to our new list along with its deadline.
3. Next, we sort the `tasks` list based on the deadlines.
4. Finally, we iterate through the sorted `tasks` list and execute each task as they arrive.

Here's a diagram illustrating the steps:

```
          +---------------+
          |  Task 1      |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Deadline: 3    |       | Deadline: 2   |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Task 2        |       | Task 3        |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of tasks.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the tasks and deadlines.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class TaskExecutor {
    public static void executeTasks(List<Task> tasks) {
        // Sort tasks based on their deadlines
        tasks.sort((t1, t2) -> Integer.compare(t2.getDeadline(), t1.getDeadline()));
        
        // Execute tasks in the sorted order
        for (Task task : tasks) {
            System.out.println("Executing task: " + task.getName());
        }
    }

    public static class Task {
        private String name;
        private int deadline;

        public Task(String name, int deadline) {
            this.name = name;
            this.deadline = deadline;
        }

        public int getDeadline() {
            return deadline;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, deadline):
        self.name = name
        self.deadline = deadline

def execute_tasks(tasks):
    # Sort tasks based on their deadlines
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x.deadline, reverse=True)
    
    # Execute tasks in the sorted order
    for task in tasks:
        print(f"Executing task: {task.name}")

# Example usage
tasks = [Task("Task 1", 3), Task("Task 2", 2), Task("Task 3", 1)]
execute_tasks(tasks)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Task {
    std::string name;
    int deadline;

    Task(std::string name, int deadline) : name(name), deadline(deadline) {}
};

void executeTasks(const std::vector<Task>& tasks) {
    // Sort tasks based on their deadlines
    std::sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(),
              [](const auto& t1, const auto& t2) {
                  return t2.deadline < t1.deadline;
              });
    
    // Execute tasks in the sorted order
    for (const auto& task : tasks) {
        std::cout << "Executing task: " << task.name << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::vector<Task> tasks = {{"Task 1", 3}, {"Task 2", 2}, {"Task 3", 1}};
    executeTasks(tasks);
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class Task {
    constructor(name, deadline) {
        this.name = name;
        this.deadline = deadline;
    }
}

function executeTasks(tasks) {
    // Sort tasks based on their deadlines
    tasks.sort((t1, t2) => t2.deadline - t1.deadline);
    
    // Execute tasks in the sorted order
    tasks.forEach(task => console.log(`Executing task: ${task.name}`));
}

// Example usage
const tasks = [{ name: "Task 1", deadline: 3 }, { name: "Task 2", deadline: 2 }, { name: "Task 3", deadline: 1 }];
executeTasks(tasks);
```
