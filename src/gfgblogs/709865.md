# Min Chars to Add for Palindrome
## Summary
Given a string, find the minimum number of characters that need to be added at the front to make it a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

This problem involves manipulating strings and checking if they are palindromes. The key concept involved is the construction of a palindrome by adding characters at the front.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the end of the string. Move them towards each other until they meet in the middle (since the string is already a palindrome).

For each step, check if the characters at the `left` and `right` positions are the same. If they are not, add the character at the `right` position to the front of the string and decrement `right`. Continue this process until `left` and `right` meet in the middle.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the end of the string.
2. While `left` and `right` do not meet:
   - Check if the characters at positions `left` and `right` are the same.
   - If they are not, add the character at position `right` to the front of the string.
   - Decrement `right`.
3. Return the number of characters added.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Space complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int minCharsToMakePalindrome(String s) {
    int left = s.length() - 1;
    int right = s.length() - 1;
    int count = 0;

    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length()) {
        if (s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right--;
        } else {
            count++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_chars_to_make_palindrome(s):
    left = len(s) - 1
    right = len(s) - 1
    count = 0

    while left >= 0 and right < len(s):
        if s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right -= 1
        else:
            count += 1
            right -= 1
    return count
```

### C++
```cpp
int minCharsToMakePalindrome(string s) {
    int left = s.length() - 1;
    int right = s.length() - 1;
    int count = 0;

    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length()) {
        if (s[left] == s[right]) {
            left--;
            right--;
        } else {
            count++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minCharsToMakePalindrome(s) {
    let left = s.length - 1;
    let right = s.length - 1;
    let count = 0;

    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length) {
        if (s[left] === s[right]) {
            left--;
            right--;
        } else {
            count++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```
