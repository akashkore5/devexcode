# Sum of Length3345

## Summary
The Sum of Length problem is an easy-level algorithmic problem that involves calculating the sum of lengths of strings in an array. This problem requires basic understanding of arrays, hash data structures, and manipulation techniques.

## Detailed Explanation
Given an array of strings, we need to find the total length of all strings in the array. The problem does not specify any constraints or restrictions on the input data, so we can assume that the input is a simple array of strings.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `totalLength` to 0. This will store the total length of all strings in the array.
2. Iterate through each string in the array using a for loop or similar iteration method.
3. For each string, calculate its length using the built-in string length function (e.g., `str.length()` in Java or Python).
4. Add the length of the current string to `totalLength`.
5. After iterating through all strings, return `totalLength` as the result.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the process:
```
  +---------------+
  | Array of Strings |
  +---------------+
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | Iterate through   |
  | each string       |
  +---------------+
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | Calculate length  |
  | and add to total  |
  +---------------+
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | Return total length|
  +---------------+
```
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of strings in the array. Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store `totalLength`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int sumOfLength(String[] strings) {
    int totalLength = 0;
    for (String str : strings) {
        totalLength += str.length();
    }
    return totalLength;
}
```

### Python
```python
def sum_of_length(strings):
    total_length = 0
    for string in strings:
        total_length += len(string)
    return total_length
```

### C++
```cpp
int sumOfLength(std::vector<std::string>& strings) {
    int totalLength = 0;
    for (const auto& str : strings) {
        totalLength += str.length();
    }
    return totalLength;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumOfLength(strings) {
    let totalLength = 0;
    for (let string of strings) {
        totalLength += string.length;
    }
    return totalLength;
}
```
