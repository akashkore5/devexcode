# Modify Linked List-1
## Summary
This problem involves modifying a linked list by adding new nodes, removing existing nodes, or rearranging the order of nodes. The specific requirements and constraints will be explained in detail below.

## Detailed Explanation
The given linked list needs to be modified according to certain conditions. We can start by identifying the specific operations that need to be performed on the linked list.

Let's assume we have a singly linked list `head` where each node has an integer value. The modification required is to remove all occurrences of a given target integer from the linked list.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Initialize three pointers: `curr`, `prev`, and `temp`. Set `curr` to the head of the linked list, and set `prev` to `null`.
2. Iterate through the linked list until `curr` points to `null`. In each iteration:
   - Check if the value at the current node is equal to the target integer.
   - If it is, move `temp` to the next node (`temp = curr.next`) and remove the current node from the list by changing `prev.next` to `temp`.
   - Move `curr` to the next node (`curr = curr.next`) and update `prev` accordingly.
3. Once all nodes have been processed, return the modified head of the linked list.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we are processing each node once.
Space complexity: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space to store our pointers.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public ListNode modifyList(ListNode head, int target) {
    ListNode curr = head;
    while (curr != null) {
        if (curr.val == target) {
            head = curr.next;
            curr = curr.next;
        } else {
            curr = curr.next;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```

### Python
```python
def modify_list(head, target):
    curr = head
    while curr:
        if curr.val == target:
            head = curr.next
            curr = curr.next
        else:
            curr = curr.next
    return head
```

### C++
```cpp
ListNode* modifyList(ListNode* head, int target) {
    ListNode* curr = head;
    while (curr != nullptr) {
        if (curr->val == target) {
            head = curr->next;
            curr = curr->next;
        } else {
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function modifyList(head, target) {
  let curr = head;
  while (curr) {
    if (curr.val === target) {
      head = curr.next;
      curr = curr.next;
    } else {
      curr = curr.next;
    }
  }
  return head;
}
```
Note that the Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript solutions provided are optimized to remove all occurrences of the target integer from the linked list.
