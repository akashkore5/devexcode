# Sort an Array of 1 to n

## Summary

This problem involves sorting a given array of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array. The task is to arrange the elements in ascending order using mathematical formulae.

## Detailed Explanation

The key concept involved in this problem is the mathematical property that the sum of all numbers from 1 to n is equal to (n * (n + 1)) / 2. This property can be used to calculate the correct position of each number in the array based on its value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Initialize an empty array `arr` with length `n`.
* Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. Let this sum be `total_sum`.
* Iterate through the input array and for each number `i`, calculate its correct position in the sorted array by subtracting 1 from `i` and multiplying it with `(total_sum - i) / (i * (i - 1)) / 2`. This value represents the correct position of `i` in the sorted array.
* Place `i` at the calculated position in the `arr` array.

Here's a sample ASCII art diagram for better understanding:

```
Input Array: [3, 1, 4, 2]
Correct Positions:
- 3: (6 - 3) / (3 * (3 - 1)) = 2
- 1: (6 - 1) / (1 * (1 - 1)) = 0
- 4: (6 - 4) / (4 * (4 - 1)) = 4
- 2: (6 - 2) / (2 * (2 - 1)) = 3

Sorted Array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Time complexity for this solution is O(n), as we are iterating through the input array once. Space complexity is also O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `arr` and intermediate variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public static void sortArray(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int correct_pos = total_sum - i;
        for (int j = 0; j < correct_pos; j++) {
            arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        }
        arr[correct_pos] = i + 1;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def sort_array(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    for i in range(n):
        correct_pos = total_sum - i
        arr[correct_pos], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[correct_pos]
```

### C++
```cpp
void sortArray(int* arr, int n) {
    int total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int correct_pos = total_sum - i;
        for (int j = 0; j < correct_pos; j++) {
            swap(&arr[j], &arr[j + 1]);
        }
        arr[correct_pos] = i + 1;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sortArray(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let correct_pos = total_sum - i;
        for (let j = 0; j < correct_pos; j++) {
            [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
        }
        arr[correct_pos] = i + 1;
    }
}
```
