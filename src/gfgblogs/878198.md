## Summary
This problem is about understanding how to use method overloading in Java. Method overloading, also known as compile-time polymorphism, allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This concept helps in providing better code readability and flexibility.

## Detailed Explanation
Method overloading is used when we want to perform an operation on different data types. For example, consider you are writing a program that calculates the area of different shapes like rectangle, circle, etc. You can define a method called `calculateArea()` with different parameters for each shape. This way, you don't have to give up a specific name but still provide different functionality based on the parameters.

Here's an example of how we can achieve this:

```
public class Shape {
    public double calculateArea(int length, int breadth) {
        return length * breadth;
    }

    public double calculateArea(double radius) {
        return 3.14 * Math.pow(radius, 2);
    }
}
```

In this example, `Shape` is a class that has two methods with the same name but different parameters: `calculateArea(int, int)` and `calculateArea(double)`. These are method overloads.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public double calculateArea(int length, int breadth) {
    return length * breadth;
}

public double calculateArea(double radius) {
    return 3.14 * Math.pow(radius, 2);
}
```

### Python
```python
def calculate_area(length, breadth):
    return length * breadth

def calculate_area(radius):
    return 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
```

### C++
```cpp
double calculateArea(int length, int breadth) {
    return length * breadth;
}

double calculateArea(double radius) {
    return 3.14 * pow(radius, 2);
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function calculateArea(length, breadth) {
    return length * breadth;
}

function calculateArea(radius) {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
}
```

Note: These solutions are not optimized in the classical sense (e.g., reducing time or space complexity), but rather provide a correct implementation of method overloading for each respective language.
