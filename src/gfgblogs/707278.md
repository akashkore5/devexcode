### Summary
Given an array of integers where all elements are present thrice except one which is present only once. Find that single element.

The problem involves bit manipulation and array processing, making it a classic example of using bitwise operations to solve a problem efficiently.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's first consider the given array `arr` of length `n`. As per the problem statement, all elements are present thrice except one which is present only once. This means that for every element `x` in the array, it appears three times at positions `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Our goal is to find this unique element.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an integer variable `result` set to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `x` in the array:
   - For each `x`, calculate its bitwise XOR with all other elements in the array using the following formula: `x ^ (arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-1])`
   - Update `result` with the calculated value.
3. The final value of `result` will be the unique element that appears only once.

Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating through each element in the array once.

Space Complexity Analysis:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the `result` variable.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int findElement(int[] arr) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int x : arr) {
        result ^= x;
    }
    return result;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def find_element(arr):
    result = 0
    for x in arr:
        result ^= x
    return result
```

#### C++
```cpp
int findElement(int* arr, int n) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result ^= arr[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function findElement(arr) {
    let result = 0;
    for (let x of arr) {
        result ^= x;
    }
    return result;
}
```
