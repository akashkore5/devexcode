**Table Difference**
=====================

## Summary
Given two tables with identical column names, find the differences between them. The problem can be approached as a comparison problem, where you need to identify the rows that exist in one table but not the other.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem requires you to compare two tables and find the rows that are present in one table but not the other. A straightforward approach would be to iterate through each row of both tables and check if a row exists in only one of them. If a row is found in one table but not the other, it's considered different.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  Initialize two sets: `table1` and `table2`. Each set will store the rows from their respective tables.
2.  Iterate through each row in both tables. For each row:
    *   Check if the row exists in only one of the tables (i.e., it's present in either `table1` or `table2`, but not both). If so, consider this row as different between the two tables.
3.  Return a set of rows that are considered different.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of rows in both tables. This is because we're iterating through each row once to find differences.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(n) as we're storing all rows from both tables in sets.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```
java
import java.util.*;

public class TableDifference {
    public static Set<String> getDifferences(HashSet<String>[] table1, HashSet<String>[] table2) {
        Set<String> differences = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < table1.length; i++) {
            differences.addAll(table1[i].difference(table2[i]));
        }

        return differences;
    }
}
```

### Python
```
python
def get_differences(table1, table2):
    differences = set()

    for row in zip(*table1):
        if row not in zip(*table2):
            differences.add(','.join(row))

    return differences
```

### C++
```
cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

std::set<std::string> getDifferences(const std::vector<std::set<std::string>>& table1, const std::vector<std::set<std::string>>& table2) {
    std::set<std::string> differences;

    for (int i = 0; i < table1.size(); i++) {
        differences.insert(table1[i].difference(table2[i]).begin(), table1[i].difference(table2[i]).end());
    }

    return differences;
}
```

### JavaScript
```
javascript
function getDifferences(table1, table2) {
    let differences = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < table1.length; i++) {
        for (let row of table1[i]) {
            if (!table2[i].has(row)) {
                differences.add(row);
            }
        }
    }

    return differences;
}
```

In each language, the solution iterates through each row in both tables and checks if a row exists in only one of them. The different rows are then added to a set, which is returned as the result.
