Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the "Greatest of Three" problem:

# Greatest of Three
## Summary
The problem is to find the greatest number among three given integers. This is a classic example of a simple comparison problem that can be solved using conditional statements.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to write a program that takes three integers as input and returns the largest one. We can use if-else statements or ternary operators to compare the numbers and find the greatest one.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Read three integers from the user (or take them as input in your program).
2. Compare the first two numbers using an if statement.
	* If the first number is greater, set it as the maximum value.
	* Else, set the second number as the maximum value.
3. Now, compare the third number with the current maximum value.
	* If the third number is greater than the maximum value, update the maximum value to be the third number.

Here's a simple diagram illustrating this process:

```
    +-------+
    |  Num1  |
    +-------+
           |
           | (Compare Num1 and Num2)
           v
    +-------+       +-------+
    |  Max   |       |  Num2  |
    +-------+       +-------+
           |             |
           | (Compare Max and Num3)
           v
    +-------+       +-------+
    |  Max   |       |  Num3  |
    +-------+       +-------+
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as we only perform a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1), as we don't use any extra space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class GreatestOfThree {
    public static int findGreatest(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
        return Math.max(Math.max(num1, num2), num3);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def greatest_of_three(num1, num2, num3):
    return max(max(num1, num2), num3)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>

int findGreatest(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
    return std::max({num1, num2, num3});
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function greatestOfThree(num1, num2, num3) {
    return Math.max(Math.max(num1, num2), num3);
}
```

These optimized solutions use the built-in `Math.max` or `std::max` functions to find the maximum value among the three numbers.
