# Right Angle Triangle
## Summary
The problem involves generating all possible right-angle triangles with a given hypotenuse length. The key concept involved is basic geometry, specifically Pythagorean triples.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by using a simple algorithm that iterates over the possible lengths of the sides and checks if they form a right-angle triangle. The algorithm starts by initializing variables for the sides (a, b) and the hypotenuse (c). Then it uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of a and calculates the corresponding value of b using the Pythagorean theorem. It then checks if the calculated value of b is less than or equal to c.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. Initialize variables: `a`, `b`, and `c` (hypotenuse)
2. Loop over possible values of `a`
3. Calculate `b` using Pythagorean theorem (`b = sqrt(c^2 - a^2)`)
4. Check if calculated value of `b` is less than or equal to `c`
5. If true, print the triangle (or store it in an array/list)

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the maximum possible value of `a`. The space complexity is O(1) since we only need a constant amount of space to store the variables.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public class RightAngleTriangle {
    public static void generate(int c) {
        for (int a = 1; a <= c; a++) {
            int b = (int) Math.sqrt(c * c - a * a);
            if (b <= c) {
                System.out.println("Triangle with sides " + a + ", " + b + ", and " + c);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
def generate(c):
    for a in range(1, c+1):
        b = int((c**2 - a**2)**0.5)
        if b <= c:
            print(f"Triangle with sides {a}, {b}, and {c}")
```
### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

void generate(int c) {
    for (int a = 1; a <= c; a++) {
        int b = static_cast<int>(sqrt(c * c - a * a));
        if (b <= c) {
            std::cout << "Triangle with sides " << a << ", " << b << ", and " << c << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function generate(c) {
    for (let a = 1; a <= c; a++) {
        let b = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(c * c - a * a));
        if (b <= c) {
            console.log(`Triangle with sides ${a}, ${b}, and ${c}`);
        }
    }
}
```
