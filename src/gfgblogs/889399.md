**Size of Doubly Linked List**
==========================

## Summary
The problem is to find the size of a doubly linked list, which is a data structure that has two pointers for each node: one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node. The goal is to write an algorithm that counts the number of nodes in the list.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start at the beginning of the doubly linked list and keep track of how many nodes we've visited until we reach the end. We'll use a variable `count` to keep track of the size of the list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Start at the head of the doubly linked list.
2. Initialize the `count` variable to 0.
3. While the current node is not null:
   - Increment the `count` variable by 1.
   - Move to the next node in the list (i.e., the one pointed to by the `next` pointer).
4. When we reach the end of the list, return the value of `count`.

Here's a diagram to illustrate this process:

```
     +---+
     | A |
     +---+       +---+
           |      /        \
           v     /          \
  +---+   +---+    +---+    +---+
  | B |   | C |    | D |    | E |
  +---+   +---+    +---+    +---+
```

In this example, the doubly linked list contains nodes A to E. We start at node A and move to each subsequent node until we reach the end of the list.

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, since we visit each node once. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the `count` variable.

## Optimized Solutions
Here are optimized solutions in various programming languages:

### Java
```java
public int sizeOfDoublyLinkedList(Node head) {
    Node current = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (current != null) {
        count++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Python
```python
def size_of_doubly_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    count = 0
    while current is not None:
        count += 1
        current = current.next
    return count
```

### C++
```cpp
int sizeOfDoublyLinkedList(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        count++;
        current = current->next;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sizeOfDoublyLinkedList(head) {
    let current = head;
    let count = 0;
    while (current !== null) {
        count++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    return count;
}
```

In each language, we start at the head of the doubly linked list and keep track of the number of nodes visited using a variable `count`. We move to each subsequent node until we reach the end of the list. The final value of `count` is the size of the doubly linked list.
