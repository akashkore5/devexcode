**Sum of distinct elements**
================================

### Summary
Given an array of integers, find the sum of all distinct elements in it. This problem is about arrays and data structures.

### Detailed Explanation
The key concept involved here is finding distinct elements in an array. We can achieve this by using a HashSet or a set data structure to store unique elements. Then we simply iterate over the original array, adding each element to our sum if it's not already present in the set.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty HashSet `distinctSet` and a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate over the input array:
	* For each element, check if it's not already present in `distinctSet`.
	* If it's not, add it to `distinctSet` and update `sum` by adding the element.
3. Return the calculated sum.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because we're making a single pass over the array and performing constant-time operations inside the loop.
Space complexity: O(n) as well, since in the worst case (when all elements are unique), we'll store every element in the `distinctSet`.

### Optimized Solutions
#### Java
```java
public int sumDistinct(int[] arr) {
    Set<Integer> distinctSet = new HashSet<>();
    int sum = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (!distinctSet.contains(num)) {
            distinctSet.add(num);
            sum += num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def sum_distinct(arr):
    distinct_set = set()
    sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num not in distinct_set:
            distinct_set.add(num)
            sum += num
    return sum
```

#### C++
```cpp
int sumDistinct(int* arr, int n) {
    unordered_set<int> distinctSet;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!distinctSet.count(arr[i])) {
            distinctSet.insert(arr[i]);
            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumDistinct(arr) {
    let distinctSet = new Set();
    let sum = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (!distinctSet.has(num)) {
            distinctSet.add(num);
            sum += num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Remember to adjust the solution according to your specific language's syntax and data structures.
