**Minimize Difference Among Task Priorities**
=====================================

## Summary

The problem is about minimizing the difference among task priorities. Given an array of task priorities and their corresponding times, we need to find the minimum difference in task priorities for a given set of tasks. This problem involves arrays and sorting concepts.

## Detailed Explanation

The approach to this problem is straightforward. We first sort the array based on task priorities. Then, we calculate the difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted array. The minimum difference among these differences will be our answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the differences.
2.  Sort the input array based on task priorities.
3.  Iterate through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.
4.  Update the minimum difference if the current difference is less than the previous minimum.

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Space complexity: O(1)

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the steps:

```
Task Priorities: [5, 2, 8, 3, 4]
Sorted Array:    [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Differences:
- (2 - 3) = 1
- (3 - 4) = 1
- (4 - 5) = 1
- (5 - 8) = 3

Minimum Difference: 1
```

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimizeTaskPriorityDifference {
    public static int minimizeTaskPriorityDifference(int[] taskPriorities, int start, int end) {
        Arrays.sort(taskPriorities);
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i <= end - start; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, taskPriorities[i] - taskPriorities[i-1]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def minimize_task_priority_difference(task_priorities):
    task_priorities.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(task_priorities)):
        min_diff = min(min_diff, task_priorities[i] - task_priorities[i-1])
    return min_diff
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int minimizeTaskPriorityDifference(std::vector<int>& taskPriorities) {
    std::sort(taskPriorities.begin(), taskPriorities.end());
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 1; i < taskPriorities.size(); i++) {
        minDiff = std::min(minDiff, taskPriorities[i] - taskPriorities[i-1]);
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minimizeTaskPriorityDifference(taskPriorities) {
    taskPriorities.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    for (let i = 1; i < taskPriorities.length; i++) {
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, taskPriorities[i] - taskPriorities[i-1]);
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```
