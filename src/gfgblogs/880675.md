### Summary
The problem involves converting a given sentence into camel case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized and the rest of the letters are in lowercase. This requires identifying the individual words in the sentence and then capitalizing the first letter of each word.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the input string and identifies the spaces that separate the words. Once we have identified the words, we can capitalize the first letter of each word and concatenate them together to form the camel case sentence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the camel case sentence.
2. Iterate through the input string character by character. For each character:
   - If the character is a space, it separates two words. In this case, capitalize the first letter of the next word and add it to the `result` string.
   - If the character is not a space, it is part of the current word. Add it to the `result` string.
3. Once we have processed all characters in the input string, return the `result` string.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public String convertToCamelCase(String sentence) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    boolean capitalizeNext = true;
    
    for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isSpaceChar(c)) {
            capitalizeNext = true;
        } else if (capitalizeNext) {
            result.append(Character.toUpperCase(c));
            capitalizeNext = false;
        } else {
            result.append(c);
        }
    }
    
    return result.toString();
}
```

#### Python
```python
def convert_to_camel_case(sentence):
    result = ""
    capitalize_next = True
    
    for c in sentence:
        if c.isspace():
            capitalize_next = True
        elif capitalize_next:
            result += c.upper()
            capitalize_next = False
        else:
            result += c
    
    return result
```

#### C++
```cpp
string convertToCamelCase(string sentence) {
    string result;
    bool capitalizeNext = true;
    
    for (char c : sentence) {
        if (isspace(c)) {
            capitalizeNext = true;
        } else if (capitalizeNext) {
            result += toupper(c);
            capitalizeNext = false;
        } else {
            result += c;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function convertToCamelCase(sentence) {
    let result = "";
    let capitalizeNext = true;
    
    for (let c of sentence) {
        if (c === " ") {
            capitalizeNext = true;
        } else if (capitalizeNext) {
            result += c.toUpperCase();
            capitalizeNext = false;
        } else {
            result += c;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

Each optimized solution iterates through the input string character by character, identifying spaces that separate words and capitalizing the first letter of each word. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we only need to process each character once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we store the camel case sentence in memory.
