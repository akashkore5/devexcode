## Summary

The problem of reversing an array is a classic algorithmic challenge. Given an array of integers, the task is to rearrange its elements in reverse order, maintaining their original values. This problem requires understanding basic array manipulation techniques and implementation skills.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input array from both ends (start and end) simultaneously. The first element of the reversed array will be the last element of the original array, the second element will be the second-to-last element, and so on. This approach ensures that all elements are correctly positioned in reverse order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize two pointers: `start` at the beginning of the array and `end` at the end.
2. While `start` is less than or equal to `end`, swap the elements at these positions.
3. Increment `start` and decrement `end` for the next iteration.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `start` becomes greater than `end`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we visit each element once.

Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and do not create any new data structures.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public static void reverseArray(int[] arr) {
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        // Swap elements at positions `start` and `end`
        int temp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def reverse_array(arr):
    start = 0
    end = len(arr) - 1
    while start <= end:
        # Swap elements at positions `start` and `end`
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1
```

### C++
```cpp
void reverseArray(int* arr, int n) {
    int start = 0;
    int end = n - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        // Swap elements at positions `start` and `end`
        int temp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function reverseArray(arr) {
    let start = 0;
    let end = arr.length - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        // Swap elements at positions `start` and `end`
        [arr[start], arr[end]] = [arr[end], arr[start]];
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```
