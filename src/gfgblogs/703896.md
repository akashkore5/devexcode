## Summary
Given an array of integers, find the maximum size of consecutive elements that are the same. For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, the output would be `1` because there are no consecutive duplicates.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the current sequence length. When we encounter a different element, we update the maximum sequence length if necessary. We also reset the current sequence length to 1 at that point.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `maxSequenceLength` and `currentSequenceLength` to 1.
2. Iterate through the array:
	* For each element, check if it's the same as the previous one.
	* If it is, increment `currentSequenceLength`.
	* If not, update `maxSequenceLength` if necessary and reset `currentSequenceLength` to 1.
3. Return `maxSequenceLength`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We only iterate through the array once.

Space complexity: O(1), since we only use a few variables to keep track of the sequence lengths.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int maxConsecutiveDuplicates(int[] arr) {
    int maxSequenceLength = 1;
    int currentSequenceLength = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) {
            currentSequenceLength++;
        } else {
            maxSequenceLength = Math.max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
            currentSequenceLength = 1;
        }
    }

    return Math.max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
}
```

### Python
```python
def max_consecutive_duplicates(arr):
    max_sequence_length = 1
    current_sequence_length = 1

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            current_sequence_length += 1
        else:
            max_sequence_length = max(max_sequence_length, current_sequence_length)
            current_sequence_length = 1

    return max(max_sequence_length, current_sequence_length)
```

### C++
```cpp
int maxConsecutiveDuplicates(int* arr, int n) {
    int maxSequenceLength = 1;
    int currentSequenceLength = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) {
            currentSequenceLength++;
        } else {
            maxSequenceLength = std::max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
            currentSequenceLength = 1;
        }
    }

    return std::max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxConsecutiveDuplicates(arr) {
    let maxSequenceLength = 1;
    let currentSequenceLength = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === arr[i - 1]) {
            currentSequenceLength++;
        } else {
            maxSequenceLength = Math.max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
            currentSequenceLength = 1;
        }
    }

    return Math.max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
}
```
