Wifi Range
======================================================

## Summary
The problem Wifi Range is an easy-level algorithmic challenge that involves calculating the range of a wifi signal. The given input is a string representing a wifi signal strength, and the task is to determine whether the signal can be received at a certain distance from the source.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple string manipulation approach. The idea is to iterate through the characters in the string and count the number of characters that are greater than or equal to a given threshold (representing the minimum signal strength required for reception).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `range` to 0, which will store the maximum distance at which the wifi signal can be received.
2. Iterate through each character in the string from left to right.
3. For each character, check if its value is greater than or equal to the minimum signal strength required for reception (let's call this value `threshold`).
4. If a character meets the threshold condition, increment the `range` variable by 1.
5. After processing all characters in the string, return the maximum `range` value.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the problem:

```
+---------------+
| Signal Strength |
|  XXXXXXXXXXXX  |
|  XXXXXXXXXX   |
|  XXXXXXX     |
|  X          |
+---------------+
```

Time complexity analysis: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Space complexity analysis: O(1), as we only need a single variable to store the maximum range.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class WifiRange {
    public static int wifiRange(String signalStrength) {
        int range = 0;
        for (char c : signalStrength.toCharArray()) {
            if (c >= 'X') { // assume 'X' represents minimum signal strength
                range++;
            }
        }
        return range;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def wifi_range(signal_strength):
    range_ = 0
    for char in signal_strength:
        if char >= 'X':  # assume 'X' represents minimum signal strength
            range_ += 1
    return range_
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <string>

int wifiRange(const std::string& signalStrength) {
    int range = 0;
    for (char c : signalStrength) {
        if (c >= 'X') {  // assume 'X' represents minimum signal strength
            range++;
        }
    }
    return range;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function wifiRange(signalStrength) {
    let range = 0;
    for (const char of signalStrength) {
        if (char >= 'X') {  // assume 'X' represents minimum signal strength
            range++;
        }
    }
    return range;
}
```

Note that the `threshold` value is hardcoded as `'X'`, but in a real-world scenario, you would likely want to pass this value as an input parameter or retrieve it from some external configuration.
