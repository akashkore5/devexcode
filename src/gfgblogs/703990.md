## Summary
The Maximum Product Cutting problem is an optimization challenge that requires finding the maximum product of a set of products obtained by cutting a given string into smaller segments. This problem involves dynamic programming concepts and involves maximizing the product of segment lengths.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to build up a solution from the bottom up. We will initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum product that can be obtained by cutting the string into segments of length `i`. 

The base case is when the length of the segment is 1. In this case, the maximum product is simply the value of the character at that position.

For lengths greater than 1, we consider all possible cuts and calculate the maximum product for each cut. We take the maximum of these products as our current `dp[i]` value. 

Finally, we return the maximum `dp` value which represents the maximum product that can be obtained by cutting the string into segments.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- Set `dp[0] = 1` as the base case for the empty string.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n`, 
   - Calculate `max_product = 0`. 
   - For each `j` from 1 to `i`, 
      - Calculate the product `product = dp[j-1] * (string[i-1]).value`.
      - Update `max_product` if `product > max_product`.
   - Set `dp[i] = max_product`.

Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: O(n) for the dynamic programming array.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(String s, int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            int max_product = 0;
            for(int j=1; j<=i; j++) {
                int product = dp[j-1] * s.charAt(i-j).getValue();
                if(product > max_product) {
                    max_product = product;
                }
            }
            dp[i] = max_product;
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
```

### Python
```python
def max_product(s, n):
    dp = [0]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        max_product = 0
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            product = dp[j-1] * s[i-j].getValue()
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product
        dp[i] = max_product
    
    return dp[n]
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(string s, int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n+1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            int max_product = 0;
            for(int j=1; j<=i; j++) {
                int product = dp[j-1] * s[i-j].getValue();
                if(product > max_product) {
                    max_product = product;
                }
            }
            dp[i] = max_product;
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxProduct(s, n) {
    let dp = new Array(n+1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    
    for(let i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        let max_product = 0;
        for(let j=1; j<=i; j++) {
            let product = dp[j-1] * s[i-j].getValue();
            if(product > max_product) {
                max_product = product;
            }
        }
        dp[i] = max_product;
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}
