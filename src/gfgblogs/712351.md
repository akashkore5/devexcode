**Minimum Absolute Difference In BST**
=====================================

### Summary

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) and its root node, find the minimum absolute difference between two nodes in the tree. The tree is represented as a node structure where each node contains an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can start by traversing the BST in ascending order, which allows us to keep track of the previous node's value. We then iterate through the nodes, calculating the absolute difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value. The minimum difference found is the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Traverse the BST in ascending order using an in-order traversal (left-root-right).
2. Initialize a variable `prev_node_value` to hold the value of the previous node.
3. Iterate through the nodes, starting from the root:
	* For each node, calculate the absolute difference between its value and `prev_node_value`.
	* Update `prev_node_value` with the current node's value.
	* Keep track of the minimum absolute difference found so far.
4. Return the minimum absolute difference found.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST, since we visit each node once during the traversal and calculation.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `prev_node_value` variable and the minimum absolute difference.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class MinimumAbsoluteDifference {
    public static int findMinimumAbsoluteDifference(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        Node prev = null;
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        inOrderTraversal(root, prev, minDiff);

        return minDiff;
    }

    private static void inOrderTraversal(Node node, Node prev, int[] minDiff) {
        if (node == null) return;

        inOrderTraversal(node.left, node, minDiff);
        if (prev != null) {
            int diff = Math.abs(node.val - prev.val);
            if (diff < minDiff[0]) {
                minDiff[0] = diff;
            }
        }
        prev = node;
        inOrderTraversal(node.right, prev, minDiff);
    }

    public static class Node {
        int val;
        Node left, right;

        public Node(int val) {
            this.val = val;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
class MinimumAbsoluteDifference:
    def find_minimum_absolute_difference(self, root):
        if not root: return 0

        prev = None
        min_diff = float('inf')
        self.in_order_traversal(root, prev, min_diff)

        return min_diff

    def in_order_traversal(self, node, prev, min_diff):
        if not node: return

        self.in_order_traversal(node.left, node, min_diff)
        if prev:
            diff = abs(node.val - prev.val)
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
        prev = node
        self.in_order_traversal(node.right, prev, min_diff)

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
```

#### C++
```cpp
class MinimumAbsoluteDifference {
public:
    int findMinimumAbsoluteDifference(Node* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;

        Node* prev = nullptr;
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        inOrderTraversal(root, prev, &minDiff);

        return minDiff;
    }

    void inOrderTraversal(Node* node, Node* prev, int* minDiff) {
        if (node == nullptr) return;

        inOrderTraversal(node->left, node, minDiff);
        if (prev != nullptr) {
            int diff = abs(node->val - prev->val);
            if (diff < *minDiff) {
                *minDiff = diff;
            }
        }
        prev = node;
        inOrderTraversal(node->right, prev, minDiff);
    }

    struct Node {
        int val;
        Node* left, *right;

        Node(int val) : val(val) {}
    };
};
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
class MinimumAbsoluteDifference {
  findMinimumAbsoluteDifference(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    let prev = null;
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    this.inOrderTraversal(root, prev, minDiff);

    return minDiff;
  }

  inOrderTraversal(node, prev, minDiff) {
    if (!node) return;

    this.inOrderTraversal(node.left, node, minDiff);
    if (prev) {
      const diff = Math.abs(node.val - prev.val);
      if (diff < minDiff) {
        minDiff = diff;
      }
    }
    prev = node;
    this.inOrderTraversal(node.right, prev, minDiff);
  }
}

class Node {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
  }
}
