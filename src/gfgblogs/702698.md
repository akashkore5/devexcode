Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the "Last seen array element" problem:

**Last Seen Array Element**
=====================

## Summary
The problem is about finding the last seen array element in an unsorted array. This involves iterating through the array and keeping track of the most recent element encountered.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from start to end, updating a variable each time we encounter a new maximum value. At the end of the iteration, the last seen array element will be stored in the variable.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `last_seen` to store the last seen array element.
2. Iterate through the array from start to end.
3. For each element, check if it is greater than the current value of `last_seen`.
4. If the element is greater, update `last_seen` with its value.
5. After iterating through the entire array, `last_seen` will hold the last seen array element.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `last_seen` variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```
java
public class LastSeenArrayElement {
    public static int findLastSeen(int[] arr) {
        int last_seen = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (i > last_seen) {
                last_seen = i;
            }
        }
        return last_seen;
    }
}
```

### Python
```
python
def find_last_seen(arr):
    last_seen = float('-inf')
    for i in arr:
        if i > last_seen:
            last_seen = i
    return last_seen
```

### C++
```
cpp
#include <iostream>
int findLastSeen(int arr[], int n) {
    int last_seen = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > last_seen) {
            last_seen = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return last_seen;
}
```

### JavaScript
```
javascript
function findLastSeen(arr) {
    let last_seen = -Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > last_seen) {
            last_seen = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return last_seen;
}
```
