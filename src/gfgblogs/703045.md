# Sum of Alternate Product (Minimize sum of alternate product)

## Summary

Given an array of integers, find the minimum sum of products that can be obtained by selecting every other element from the array and multiplying them together. The array is of size `n`. This problem involves arrays and basic algorithms, making it a fundamental exercise in computer science.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1.  Initialize two variables: `min_sum` to store the minimum sum of products, and `current_product` to keep track of the product of selected elements.
2.  Iterate over the array from left to right, selecting every other element (i.e., `0th`, `2nd`, `4th`, ... indices).
3.  For each selected element, multiply it with `current_product`.
4.  Update `min_sum` if the current product is smaller.
5.  Return `min_sum`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

```
min_sum = infinity
current_product = 1

for i from 0 to n-1 (step 2):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        current_product *= arr\[i]
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_product)

return min_sum
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), as we need to iterate over the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store `min_sum` and `current_product`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int minSumOfAlternateProduct(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    long minSum = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long currentProduct = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            currentProduct *= arr[i];
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentProduct);
        }
    }

    return (int) minSum;
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_sum_of_alternate_product(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    min_sum = float('inf')
    current_product = 1

    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            current_product *= arr[i]
            min_sum = min(min_sum, current_product)

    return int(min_sum)
```

### C++
```cpp
int minSumOfAlternateProduct(int* arr, int n) {
    long minSum = LONG_MAX;
    long currentProduct = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            currentProduct *= arr\[i];
            minSum = std::min(minSum, currentProduct);
        }
    }

    return (int) minSum;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minSumOfAlternateProduct(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let minSum = Infinity;
    let currentProduct = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            currentProduct *= arr\[i];
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentProduct);
        }
    }

    return Math.floor(minSum);
}
```

These optimized solutions in different programming languages demonstrate the basic algorithm to find the minimum sum of products by selecting every other element from the array and multiplying them together.
