# Find Smallest Non-Zero Number

## Summary
The problem involves finding the smallest non-zero number in a given array. This is a classic algorithmic problem that requires understanding of basic programming concepts and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the array, keeping track of the smallest non-zero number encountered so far. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `smallest` to store the smallest non-zero number.
2. Iterate through the array:
	* For each element in the array, check if it is not zero (`if (element != 0)`).
	* If the element is not zero and smaller than the current `smallest`, update `smallest`.
3. After iterating through the entire array, `smallest` will hold the smallest non-zero number found.

Here's a diagram illustrating the process:
```
          +---------------+
          |       Array    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  v
+---------------------+
|  Iterate through   |
|  elements and find  |
|  smallest non-zero   |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|  Return smallest    |
|  non-zero number    |
+---------------------+
```
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we need to iterate through each element once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `smallest` variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int findSmallestNonZeroNumber(int[] arr) {
    int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int element : arr) {
        if (element != 0 && element < smallest) {
            smallest = element;
        }
    }
    return smallest;
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_smallest_non_zero_number(arr):
    smallest = float('inf')
    for element in arr:
        if element != 0 and element < smallest:
            smallest = element
    return smallest
```

### C++
```cpp
int findSmallestNonZeroNumber(int* arr, int n) {
    int smallest = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != 0 && arr[i] < smallest) {
            smallest = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return smallest;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findSmallestNonZeroNumber(arr) {
    let smallest = Infinity;
    for (let element of arr) {
        if (element !== 0 && element < smallest) {
            smallest = element;
        }
    }
    return smallest;
}
```
Note that the optimized solutions are provided in the corresponding languages, and they all follow the same basic approach as described above.
