## Summary
Print Square is a basic problem that involves printing a square pattern of asterisks (*) based on the given input. The problem requires you to create an algorithm that prints a square with side length n where n is the user's input.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by using nested loops. The outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loop controls the number of columns. We use conditionals to check if we're at the edge of the square and adjust our printing accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an integer variable `n` to store the side length of the square.
2. Use two nested loops, one for rows and one for columns. The outer loop runs from 0 to n-1, while the inner loop runs from 0 to n-1 as well.
3. Inside the inner loop, print asterisks (*) based on the current row and column indices. If we're at the edge of the square (i.e., `row` or `col` is equal to 0 or n-1), print a newline character (`\n`) before printing the remaining characters.
4. After the loops finish executing, return from the function.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class PrintSquare {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // example input
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1) {
                    System.out.print("* ");
                } else {
                    System.out.print("   ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def print_square(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 or i == n - 1 or j == 0 or j == n - 1:
                print("* ", end="")
            else:
                print("   ", end="")
        print()

# Example usage
print_square(5)
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printSquare(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1)
                std::cout << "* ";
            else
                std::cout << "   ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // example input
    printSquare(n);
    return 0;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function printSquare(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1)
                process.stdout.write("* ");
            else
                process.stdout.write("   ");
        }
        process.stdout.write("\n");
    }
}

// Example usage
printSquare(5);
```

Note that the above solutions print a square with side length `n`, where `n` is the user's input. You can modify the code to accept user input or use a specific value for `n`.
