# Function Pointer as Parameter

## Summary

This problem involves passing a function pointer as a parameter to another function. The key concept is that of function pointers, which are used to point to and invoke other functions. This problem requires understanding how to pass a function as an argument to another function and using it to perform specific operations.

## Detailed Explanation

The problem can be thought of as having a function `f(x)` that takes one argument `x`. We want to write another function `g(f, n)` that takes two arguments: the function `f` and an integer `n`. The function `g` should return the value of `f(n)`. 

One way to solve this problem is by using a lambda function. A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only return one value.

Here's how you can do it:

1.  Write a lambda function `f` that takes an integer as an argument and returns its square.
2.  Pass this lambda function to the `g` function along with another integer `n`.
3.  The `g` function should call the passed lambda function with the given integer `n` and return the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  Start by defining the `f(x)` function that takes one argument `x` and returns its square.
2.  Define the `g(f, n)` function that takes two arguments: the function `f` and an integer `n`.
3.  Inside the `g` function, call the passed lambda function with the given integer `n` using the syntax `f(n)`.
4.  Return the result of this operation.

Time complexity for this solution is O(1), as it involves a constant number of operations. Space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the lambda function and the integer `n`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class Main {
    public static int g(Function<Integer, Integer> f, int n) {
        return f.apply(n);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
        System.out.println(g(square, 4)); // prints 16
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def g(f, n):
    return f(n)

square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(g(square, 4))  # prints 16
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>

int g(std::function<int(int)> f, int n) {
    return f(n);
}

int main() {
    auto square = [](int x) { return x * x; };
    std::cout << g(square, 4) << std::endl; // prints 16
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function g(f, n) {
    return f(n);
}

let square = x => x ** 2;
console.log(g(square, 4));  // prints 16
```
