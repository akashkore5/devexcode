# Triangle and Square

## Summary
The problem is to find whether a given set of integers can form both a triangle and a square. A triangle is formed when three sides are provided, and a square is formed when all four sides are equal. This problem requires a combination of mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of triangles and squares. A triangle can be formed with any three integers that satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of two sides must be greater than the third side. On the other hand, a square requires all four sides to be equal.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. First, we need to generate all possible combinations of three integers from the given set.
2. For each combination, check if it satisfies the triangle inequality. If it does, mark it as a potential triangle.
3. Next, sort the integers in ascending order and find all possible combinations of four integers that are equal.
4. For each combination, check if it forms a square (i.e., all sides are equal). If it does, mark it as a potential square.
5. Finally, check if there is at least one potential triangle and one potential square.

If both conditions are met, the set of integers can form both a triangle and a square.

Time complexity: O(n^3), where n is the number of integers in the set.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only need a constant amount of space to store the temporary results.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public boolean canFormTriangleAndSquare(int[] nums) {
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        if (nums[i] + nums[i+1] > nums[i+2]) {
            // check if the remaining three integers form a square
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i+3; j < nums.length; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
                if (sum == nums[i+2]) return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Python
```python
def can_form_triangle_and_square(nums):
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i] + nums[i+1] > nums[i+2]:
            # check if the remaining three integers form a square
            sum = 0
            for j in range(i+3, len(nums)):
                sum += nums[j]
                if sum == nums[i+2]: return True
    return False
```

### C++
```cpp
bool canFormTriangleAndSquare(int* nums, int n) {
    std::sort(nums, nums+n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n-2; i++) {
        if (nums[i] + nums[i+1] > nums[i+2]) {
            // check if the remaining three integers form a square
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i+3; j < n; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
                if (sum == nums[i+2]) return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function canFormTriangleAndSquare(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        if (nums[i] + nums[i+1] > nums[i+2]) {
            // check if the remaining three integers form a square
            let sum = 0;
            for (let j = i+3; j < nums.length; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
                if (sum === nums[i+2]) return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
