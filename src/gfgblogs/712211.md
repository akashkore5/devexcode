### Summary
Given an array of integers, we need to find out whether there exists a subsequence in the given array with sum equal to K. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Detailed Explanation
The problem involves finding a subsequence in the given array whose sum equals K. We will use a dynamic programming approach for this solution. Let's initialize an array `dp` of size `K + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents whether there exists a subsequence with sum equal to `i`.

Here are the steps:

* Initialize `dp[0] = true`, since an empty subsequence has a sum of 0.
* Iterate over the given array. For each element, update the `dp` array as follows:
	+ If the current element is greater than K, then we don't need to consider it in our subsequence, so `dp[i + arr[i]] = dp[i]` for all `i <= K - arr[i]`.
	+ Otherwise, update `dp[i + arr[i]] = true`, since we have found a new way to reach sum `i + arr[i]`.

At the end of this process, check if `dp[K]` is `true`. If it is, then there exists a subsequence with sum K. Otherwise, return false.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the given array.
Space complexity: O(K), since we are using an array of size K + 1 to store our dynamic programming table.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public boolean checkSubsequenceSum(int[] arr, int K) {
    boolean[] dp = new boolean[K + 1];
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i : arr) {
        if (i > K) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= K - i; j++) {
                dp[j + i] = dp[j];
            }
        } else {
            dp[i] = true;
        }
    }
    return dp[K];
}
```

#### Python
```python
def check_subsequence_sum(arr, K):
    dp = [False] * (K + 1)
    dp[0] = True
    for i in arr:
        if i > K:
            for j in range(K - i + 1):
                dp[j + i] = dp[j]
        else:
            dp[i] = True
    return dp[K]
```

#### C++
```cpp
bool checkSubsequenceSum(int* arr, int n, int K) {
    bool* dp = new bool[K + 1];
    dp[0] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > K) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= K - arr[i]; j++) {
                dp[j + arr[i]] = dp[j];
            }
        } else {
            dp[arr[i]] = true;
        }
    }
    delete[] dp;
    return dp[K];
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function checkSubsequenceSum(arr, K) {
    let dp = new Array(K + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true;
    for (let i of arr) {
        if (i > K) {
            for (let j = 0; j <= K - i; j++) {
                dp[j + i] = dp[j];
            }
        } else {
            dp[i] = true;
        }
    }
    return dp[K];
}
```
