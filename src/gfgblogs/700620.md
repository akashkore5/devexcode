**Find Length of Loop**
=====================

### Summary
Find the length of a loop in a linked list. The problem involves identifying a cycle in the linked list and then finding its length.

### Detailed Explanation
Given a linked list, find the length of the loop. A loop is formed when there are duplicate nodes (not necessarily adjacent) in the linked list. This can be solved by using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm).

Here's how it works:

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list.
2. Move both pointers one step at a time. The `slow` pointer moves one node at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two nodes at a time.
3. If there is a loop in the linked list, the `fast` pointer will eventually meet the `slow` pointer within the loop.
4. Once they meet, move both pointers to the head of the linked list and repeat steps 2-3 until they meet again. The distance between their meeting points is the length of the loop.

Here's an ASCII art diagram:
```
   A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F
      |         |
      +---------+
```
In this example, nodes `E` and `F` form a cycle.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space complexity: O(1).

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int findLengthOfLoop(Node head) {
    Node slow = head;
    Node fast = head;

    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;

        if (slow == fast) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
        return 0; // no loop found
    }

    int length = 1;
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;

    while (slow != fast) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        length++;
    }

    return length;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def find_length_of_loop(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if slow == fast:
            break
    if not (fast and fast.next):
        return 0 # no loop found

    length = 1
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        length += 1

    return length
```

#### C++
```cpp
int findLengthOfLoop(Node* head) {
    Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;

    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;

        if (slow == fast) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!fast || !fast->next) {
        return 0; // no loop found
    }

    int length = 1;
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;

    while (slow != fast) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
        length++;
    }

    return length;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function findLengthOfLoop(head) {
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;

        if (slow === fast) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!fast || !fast.next) {
        return 0; // no loop found
    }

    let length = 1;
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;

    while (slow !== fast) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        length++;
    }

    return length;
}
```
