## Summary

The problem of finding the factorial of a given integer is a basic algorithmic problem. The key concept involved is recursion or iterative approach to calculate the factorial of a number. Factorial of a number n is denoted by n! and it is calculated as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## Detailed Explanation

The simplest way to calculate the factorial of a given integer is using an iterative approach with a loop. The idea is to initialize a variable `result` to 1, then for each number from 2 to the input number, multiply `result` by that number. This process continues until the input number becomes 0.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
* Start a loop from 2 to the input number (inclusive).
* In each iteration of the loop, multiply `result` by the current number.
* After the loop finishes, `result` will be the factorial of the input number.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the input number. The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `result`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Factorial {
    public static long factorial(int n) {
        long result = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

### C++
```cpp
class Factorial {
public:
    long long factorial(int n) {
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    let result = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
```
Note: The above solutions use iterative approach to calculate the factorial.
