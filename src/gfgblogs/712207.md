**Aggressive Cows**

## Summary
The Aggressive Cows problem involves determining the maximum number of cows that can be placed in a field such that no two aggressive cows are placed together. The input consists of an array of integers representing the positions where the cows can be placed.


## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to sort the cow positions first and then iterate through the sorted array to find the maximum number of non-aggressive cow pairs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  Sort the input array in ascending order.
2.  Initialize two variables `count` and `maxCount` to store the current count and maximum count of non-aggressive cows, respectively.
3.  Iterate through the sorted array. For each pair of positions `(i, i+1)`, check if the distance between them is greater than or equal to `2` (since aggressive cows must be separated by at least one space). If the condition is met, increment `count`.
4.  Update `maxCount` with the maximum value it has seen so far.
5.  Return `maxCount` as the result.

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of cow positions.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.


## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class AggressiveCows {
    public static int aggressiveCows(int[] position) {
        Arrays.sort(position);
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] - position[i-1] >= 2) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }

        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def aggressive_cows(position):
    position.sort()
    count = 0
    max_count = 0

    for i in range(1, len(position)):
        if position[i] - position[i-1] >= 2:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        max_count = max(max_count, count)

    return max_count
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int aggressiveCows(std::vector<int>& position) {
    std::sort(position.begin(), position.end());
    int count = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); i++) {
        if (position[i] - position[i-1] >= 2) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count = 0;
        }
        maxCount = std::max(maxCount, count);
    }

    return maxCount;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function aggressiveCows(position) {
    position.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 0;
    let maxCount = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
        if (position[i] - position[i-1] >= 2) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count = 0;
        }
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
    }

    return maxCount;
}
```
