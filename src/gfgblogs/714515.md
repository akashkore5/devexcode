### Summary
This problem requires you to write a function that counts the total number of set bits in all numbers from 1 to N. A set bit is a bit that has a value of 1. For example, the binary representation of 9 (which is 1001) has two set bits.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach by iterating over each number from 1 to N and counting the set bits for each number. We can do this using bitwise operations. Specifically, we can use the expression `n & (n - 1)` to count the number of set bits in `n`. This works because the leftmost set bit will be shifted to the right when we subtract 1 from `n`, and all other bits will remain unchanged.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `setbits` to 0, which will store the total number of set bits.
2. Iterate over each number `i` from 1 to N.
3. For each number `i`, count the number of set bits using the expression `i & (i - 1)`. This gives us the number of set bits in `i`.
4. Add this count to the total setbits variable.
5. Return the total setbits variable.

Here's a time complexity analysis: O(N), where N is the input size. We need to iterate over each number from 1 to N, so the time complexity is linear.

Here's a space complexity analysis: O(1). We only need a constant amount of space to store the total setbits variable, so the space complexity is constant.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int countTotalSetBits(int n) {
    int setbits = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        setbits += Integer.bitCount(i);
    }
    return setbits;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def count_total_set_bits(n):
    setbits = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        setbits += bin(i).count('1')
    return setbits
```

#### C++
```cpp
int countTotalSetBits(int n) {
    int setbits = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        setbits += __builtin_popcount(i);
    }
    return setbits;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function countTotalSetBits(n) {
    let setbits = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        setbits += (i & (i - 1)).toString(2).split('').filter(b => b === '1').length;
    }
    return setbits;
}
```
