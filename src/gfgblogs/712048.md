# Print N to 1 without Loop

## Summary
This problem requires you to print numbers from N to 1, but without using a loop. The key concept involved is recursion, which allows us to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them in a similar way.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use recursion to print the numbers from N to 1. Here's how it works:

* We start by printing the number N.
* Then, we call the same function recursively with N-1 as the input.
* This process continues until we reach 1, at which point we stop calling the function.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
```
PrintN(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        PrintN(n - 1);
        System.out.println(n);
    }
}
```
We start by printing the number N. Then, we call the same function recursively with N-1 as the input. This process continues until we reach 1, at which point we stop calling the function.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the input number. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the recursive function call.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class PrintN {
    public static void printN(int n) {
        if (n > 0) {
            System.out.println(n);
            printN(n - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printN(5); // prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def print_n(n):
    if n > 0:
        print(n)
        print_n(n - 1)

print_n(5)  # prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printN(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        std::cout << n << std::endl;
        printN(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    printN(5); // prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function printN(n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        console.log(n);
        printN(n - 1);
    }
}

printN(5); // prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```
Note that the optimized solutions are just variations of the same recursive algorithm.
