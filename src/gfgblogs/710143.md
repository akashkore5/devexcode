### Summary
Given a set of intervals, find the maximum number of overlapping intervals. This problem involves understanding and manipulating intervals in a way that maximizes overlap.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use a greedy approach to keep track of the current maximum count of overlapping intervals. We initialize our count to 1, as there is at least one interval. Then, for each subsequent interval, we check if it overlaps with the previous one (i.e., its start time is less than or equal to the end time of the previous interval). If it does overlap, we increment our count; otherwise, we reset the count to 1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `maxCount` to 1.
2. Iterate through each interval in the set.
3. For each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous one (i.e., its start time is less than or equal to the end time of the previous interval).
4. If it does overlap, increment `maxCount`.
5. If not, reset `maxCount` to 1.
6. Return `maxCount`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of intervals.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to keep track of our count.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int maxOverlap(int[][] intervals) {
    if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;

    int maxCount = 1;
    Interval prevInterval = new Interval(intervals[0][0], intervals[0][1]);

    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        Interval currInterval = new Interval(intervals[i][0], intervals[i][1]);
        if (currInterval.start <= prevInterval.end) {
            maxCount++;
        } else {
            maxCount = 1;
        }
        prevInterval = currInterval;
    }

    return maxCount;
}

class Interval {
    int start;
    int end;

    public Interval(int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def max_overlap(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    max_count = 1
    prev_interval = intervals[0]

    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        if interval[0] <= prev_interval[1]:
            max_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = 1
        prev_interval = interval

    return max_count
```

#### C++
```cpp
int maxOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    if (intervals.empty()) return 0;

    int maxCount = 1;
    Interval prevInterval = {intervals[0][0], intervals[0][1]};

    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
        Interval currInterval = {intervals[i][0], intervals[i][1]};
        if (currInterval.start <= prevInterval.end) {
            maxCount++;
        } else {
            maxCount = 1;
        }
        prevInterval = currInterval;
    }

    return maxCount;
}

struct Interval {
    int start;
    int end;

    Interval(int start, int end) : start(start), end(end) {}
};
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxOverlap(intervals) {
    if (!intervals.length) return 0;

    let maxCount = 1;
    let prevInterval = intervals[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        const currInterval = intervals[i];
        if (currInterval[0] <= prevInterval[1]) {
            maxCount++;
        } else {
            maxCount = 1;
        }
        prevInterval = currInterval;
    }

    return maxCount;
}
```
