# Positive Distinct Count

## Summary
Given an array of integers, this problem requires you to count the number of distinct positive elements in the array. The key concept involved is arrays and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the array and checking if each element is greater than zero. If it is, we increment a counter for the positive distinct elements. This approach ensures that we only count each positive number once, hence the term "distinct".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from start to end.
3. For each element in the array, check if it is greater than zero.
4. If the element is positive, increment the `count` variable.
5. Return the final value of `count`, which represents the number of distinct positive elements.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, since we are making a single pass through the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int positiveDistinctCount(int[] arr) {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (num > 0) {
            set.add(num);
        }
    }
    return set.size();
}
```

### Python
```python
def positive_distinct_count(arr):
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num > 0:
            seen.add(num)
    return len(seen)
```

### C++
```cpp
int positiveDistinctCount(int* arr, int n) {
    unordered_set<int> seen;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > 0) {
            seen.insert(arr[i]);
        }
    }
    return seen.size();
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function positiveDistinctCount(arr) {
    let set = new Set();
    let count = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num > 0) {
            set.add(num);
        }
    }
    return set.size();
}
```
