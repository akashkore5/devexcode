## Summary

Given a linked list, the task is to find the kth node from the end of the linked list. This problem involves working with linked lists and understanding how to traverse them efficiently.

## Detailed Explanation

The approach for this problem is to use two pointers. One pointer moves at a speed of 1 node per step while the other pointer moves at a speed of (k+1) nodes per step. Initially, both pointers are set to the start of the linked list. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, the slow pointer will be k nodes away from the end.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Create two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. Move the `fast` pointer (k+1) steps ahead.
3. Move both pointers one step at a time until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the linked list.
4. The node pointed to by the `slow` pointer is the kth node from the end.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we are traversing the linked list once.

Space complexity: O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getKthFromEnd(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        while (fast != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getKthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        for i in range(k):
            fast = fast.next
        
        while fast is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        
        return slow
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* getKthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int k) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        while (fast != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class Solution {
  getKthFromEnd(head, k) {
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    while (fast !== null) {
      slow = slow.next;
      fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    return slow;
  }
}
```
