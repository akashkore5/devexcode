## Summary
Print in Python is a basic programming problem that involves printing specific information. This problem does not involve complex data structures or algorithms, but rather focuses on the use of various methods to print output.

## Detailed Explanation
The main idea behind this problem is to understand how to print different types of data and formatting. In Python, we have several ways to print information, including using the `print()` function with its default settings or by formatting the output manually.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  **Printing Strings**: We can use the `print()` function directly on strings without any formatting.
    ```python
    name = "John"
    print(name)
    ```

2.  **Printing Integers**: We can also print integers using the `print()` function with no formatting.
    ```python
    age = 25
    print(age)
    ```

3.  **Printing Floats**: Printing floats works similarly to printing integers, except we might need to specify a certain number of decimal places.
    ```python
    height = 1.75
    print(height)
    ```

4.  **Printing Multiple Values**: If we want to print multiple values with formatting, we can use the `print()` function multiple times or use string formatting.
    ```python
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    print(name, "is", age, "years old.")
    ```

5.  **String Formatting**: We can also use string formatting to customize our output. This allows us to specify the type of data and how it should be displayed.
    ```python
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
    ```

The time complexity for these operations is O(1), as we are not iterating over any data structures. The space complexity is also O(1), as we are only printing a fixed amount of output.

## Optimized Solutions

#### Python
Here's the optimized solution in Python:
```python
name = "John"
age = 25
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

Note that this problem does not have any optimized solutions, as the original code provided already has a time complexity of O(1).
