### Summary

Given an array of integers, determine if the sequence is in arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. For example, the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8 is in arithmetic progression with common difference 2.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the array and checks if each element is the sum of the previous element and a fixed constant (the common difference). If any pair of elements does not meet this condition, then the sequence is not in arithmetic progression. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize two variables: `common_diff` to store the potential common difference and `last_elem` to store the last element processed.
2. Iterate through the array:
	* For each element `elem`, calculate the potential common difference by subtracting the previous element (`last_elem`) from `elem`.
	* If this is the first element or if the calculated common difference matches the previously found common difference, update `common_diff` and set `last_elem` to `elem`.
3. After processing all elements, check if the sequence is in arithmetic progression by verifying that each element minus the previous element equals the common difference.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public boolean checkArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
    int common_diff = 0;
    int last_elem = arr[0];
    
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int diff = arr[i] - last_elem;
        
        if (i == 1 || diff == common_diff) {
            common_diff = diff;
            last_elem = arr[i];
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def check_arithmetic_progression(arr):
    common_diff = 0
    last_elem = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        diff = arr[i] - last_elem
        
        if i == 1 or diff == common_diff:
            common_diff = diff
            last_elem = arr[i]
        else:
            return False
    
    return True
```

#### C++
```cpp
bool checkArithmeticProgression(int* arr, int n) {
    int common_diff = 0;
    int last_elem = arr[0];
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int diff = arr[i] - last_elem;
        
        if (i == 1 || diff == common_diff) {
            common_diff = diff;
            last_elem = arr[i];
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function checkArithmeticProgression(arr) {
    let common_diff = 0;
    let last_elem = arr[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let diff = arr[i] - last_elem;
        
        if (i === 1 || diff === common_diff) {
            common_diff = diff;
            last_elem = arr[i];
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
