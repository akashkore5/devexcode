## Summary
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. This problem focuses on understanding the importance of encapsulation in Java.

## Detailed Explanation
To demonstrate encapsulation, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to create a simple BankAccount class with attributes like account number, balance, and interest rate, as well as methods for depositing and withdrawing money. Without encapsulation, our code might look like this:
```java
public class BankAccount {
    public int accountNumber;
    public double balance;
    public double interestRate;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds!");
        }
    }
}
```
This code has several issues:

* The data attributes are publicly accessible, allowing other parts of the program to modify them directly.
* The methods can only access and modify the local variables, but they don't guarantee any specific behavior or constraints.

To fix these problems, we'll encapsulate our data and methods using private attributes and public getter/setter methods:
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private int accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private double interestRate;

    public BankAccount(int accountNumber, double balance, double interestRate) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount!");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds!");
        }
    }

    public int getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public double getInterestRate() {
        return interestRate;
    }
}
```
In this revised version, we've made the data attributes private and added getter/setter methods to access and modify them. This encapsulation ensures that our BankAccount class is more robust, secure, and easier to maintain.

## Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private int accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private double interestRate;

    public BankAccount(int accountNumber, double balance, double interestRate) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount!");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds!");
        }
    }

    public int getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public double getInterestRate() {
        return interestRate;
    }
}
```

(Note: There is no optimized solution, as the provided code already demonstrates good encapsulation practices.)
