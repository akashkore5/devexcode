## Summary
The problem is about finding visible numbers in an array. A number is considered visible if it's not hidden by any other number to its left or right. The key concepts involved are arrays and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we'll iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum visible number encountered so far. For each element in the array, we check if it's greater than the current maximum visible number. If it is, we update the maximum visible number. If not, we know that all numbers to the right of the current element will be hidden by this element, so we don't need to consider them further.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize the maximum visible number to negative infinity.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each element, check if it's greater than the current maximum visible number.
4. If it is, update the maximum visible number and reset the count of hidden numbers to 0.
5. If not, increment the count of hidden numbers.
6. Continue until the end of the array.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only need a single variable to store the maximum visible number.

## Optimized Solutions
### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int maxVisibleNumber(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = INT_MIN;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 3, 4, 2};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    cout << "Maximum visible number: " << maxVisibleNumber(arr, n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This solution uses the `INT_MIN` constant from the `<climits>` header to initialize the maximum visible number. The rest of the solution is similar to the detailed explanation above.
