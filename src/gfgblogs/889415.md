# Remove all occurrences of a character in a string

## Summary
The problem is to remove all occurrences of a specific character from a given string. This involves iterating over the input string, identifying and removing instances of the target character.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string using a for loop or equivalent. For each character in the string, we check if it matches our target character. If it does, we remove it from the string. We can use various methods to achieve this, such as replacing the target character with an empty string, or manually manipulating the characters.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the modified input string.
2. Iterate through each character `char` in the input string.
3. Check if `char` matches our target character (e.g., using the equality operator).
4. If it does, append the remaining characters up to the current index to `result`.
5. Remove the matched character from the original string by skipping it during iteration.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all characters have been processed.
7. Return the modified `result` string.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we iterate through each character once. Space complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store our result and temporary variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public String removeCharacter(String str, char c) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
        if (ch != c) {
            result.append(ch);
        }
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```

### Python
```python
def remove_character(s, c):
    return "".join([i for i in s if i != c])
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::string removeCharacter(std::string str, char c) {
    std::stringstream result;
    for (char ch : str) {
        if (ch != c) {
            result << ch;
        }
    }
    return result.str();
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function removeCharacter(str, c) {
  let result = "";
  for (let char of str) {
    if (char !== c) {
      result += char;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
