**For Loop - 2**
==================

### Summary
The problem requires you to write a program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to n. The key concept involved is the use of for loops in programming.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start by initializing a variable `sum` to zero, which will store the sum of squares. Then, we use a for loop that runs from 1 to n (inclusive). Inside the loop, we calculate the square of the current number and add it to `sum`. Finally, we print out the calculated sum.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum += i ** 2
print(sum)
```
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we are iterating through all numbers from 1 to n. The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `sum` variable.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class ForLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += i * i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```
#### Python
```python
n = 5
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum += i ** 2
print(sum)
```
#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i * i;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
#### JavaScript
```javascript
let n = 5;
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i ** 2;
}
console.log(sum);
```
