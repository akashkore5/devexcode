# Merging two unsorted arrays in sorted order

## Summary

This problem involves merging two unsorted arrays into a single, sorted array. The key concepts involved are sorting and data structures, as indicated by the tags "Sorting" and "Arrays".

## Detailed Explanation

The approach to solving this problem is to first concatenate both arrays into one, and then sort it using a suitable algorithm such as QuickSort or MergeSort.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Concatenate the two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2` into a single array `result`.
2. Sort the `result` array using a sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort.
3. Return the sorted `result` array as the final output.

Here's an example of how this process would work with two input arrays `[4, 7]` and `[3, 9, 10]`. First, we concatenate them into one array: `[4, 7, 3, 9, 10]`. Then, we sort it to get the final output: `[3, 4, 7, 9, 10]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the concatenated array.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int[] mergeSortedArrays(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    int[] result = new int[arr1.length + arr2.length];
    System.arraycopy(arr1, 0, result, 0, arr1.length);
    System.arraycopy(arr2, 0, result, arr1.length, arr2.length);
    Arrays.sort(result);
    return result;
}
```

### Python
```python
def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    result = arr1 + arr2
    result.sort()
    return result
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
int* mergeSortedArrays(int* arr1, int len1, int* arr2, int len2) {
    int* result = new int[len1 + len2];
    for (int i = 0; i < len1; i++) {
        result[i] = arr1[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < len2; i++) {
        result[len1 + i] = arr2[i];
    }
    std::sort(result, result + len1 + len2);
    return result;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function mergeSortedArrays(arr1, arr2) {
    const result = [...arr1, ...arr2].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return result;
}
```
