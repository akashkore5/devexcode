# Print Statement

## Summary

The problem involves printing a statement in various programming languages, specifically Python, CPP, Java, and JavaScript. The key concept involved is basic input/output operations.

## Detailed Explanation

The task is to print a given statement using the standard output stream. In most programming languages, this can be achieved using the `print()` function or its equivalent.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define the statement as a string.
2. Use the `print()` function to print the statement.

For example, in Python:
```
statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!"
print(statement)
```

In Java:
```java
String statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
System.out.println(statement);
```

In C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::string statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
    std::cout << statement << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In JavaScript:
```javascript
let statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
console.log(statement);
```

Time complexity for this problem is O(1) as we are simply printing the given statement. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the statement.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
String statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
System.out.println(statement);
```

### Python
```
statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!"
print(statement)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::string statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
    std::cout << statement << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
let statement = "Hello, GeeksforGeeks!";
console.log(statement);
```
