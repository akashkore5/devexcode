**Minimize number of Students to be removed**
=====================================

## Summary
We are given an array `arr` where each element represents a student's height. We need to find the minimum number of students that should be removed such that no two students have equal heights remaining after removal. The problem requires us to apply dynamic programming to solve this optimization issue.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. Our goal is to minimize the number of students that should be removed. We can start by initializing a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of students that should be removed from indices `[0..i]` such that no two students have equal heights and the maximum height among them is `j`.

The base case for our recursion is when `i == 0`, in which case we don't need to remove any students. Now, let's consider the recursive case where `i > 0`. If the current student at index `i` has a height greater than or equal to `j`, then we can either include this student and recursively calculate the minimum number of students that should be removed from indices `[1..i]` with maximum height `j-1`, or exclude this student and recursively calculate the minimum number of students that should be removed from indices `[0..i-1]` with maximum height `j`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
```markdown
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case)
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from max(arr) down to min(arr):
        if arr[i] >= j:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
return dp[n][max(arr)]
```
Time complexity: O(n \* max(arr)) where `n` is the number of students and `max(arr)` is the maximum height.
Space complexity: O(n \* max(arr))

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class MinimizeNumberStudents {
    public static int minRemove(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = new int[arr[0]];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = arr[0]; j >= arr[i]; j--) {
                if (arr[i] >= j) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n-1][arr[0]];
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_remove(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(max(arr))] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(max(arr), min(arr)-1, -1):
            if arr[i] >= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    return dp[n-1][max(arr)]
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minRemove(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(arr[0], 0));
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = arr[0]; j >= arr[i]; j--) {
            if (arr[i] >= j) {
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n-1][arr[0]];
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {5, 3, 2, 7, 5};
    int min_students_to_remove = minRemove(arr);
    std::cout << "Minimum number of students to remove: " << min_students_to_remove << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minRemove(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let dp = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => Array(Math.max(...arr)).fill(0));
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = Math.max(...arr); j >= Math.min(...arr)-1; j--) {
            if (arr[i] >= j) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n-1][Math.max(...arr)];
}

let arr = [5, 3, 2, 7, 5];
let min_students_to_remove = minRemove(arr);
console.log("Minimum number of students to remove: " + min_students_to_remove);
```
