**Find minimum number of Laptops required**
=====================================

## Summary
In this problem, we are asked to find the minimum number of laptops required to distribute among a set of students. Each student has a specific requirement for laptops and can be assigned multiple laptops. We need to determine how many laptops should be purchased to meet all the requirements.

The key concepts involved in this problem are sorting and algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will first sort the students' laptop requirements in ascending order. Then, we will iterate through the sorted list and assign laptops until we have met all the requirements. If a student requires more laptops than we have available, we will need to purchase additional laptops to meet their requirement.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Sort the students' laptop requirements in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable `laptops_required` to keep track of the minimum number of laptops required.
3. Iterate through the sorted list and assign laptops until we have met all the requirements.
4. If a student requires more laptops than we have available, increment `laptops_required` by 1.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of students. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sorted list and the `laptops_required` variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Laptops {
    public static int minLaptops(int[] requirements) {
        Arrays.sort(requirements);
        int laptops_required = 0;
        for (int requirement : requirements) {
            if (requirement > laptops_required) {
                laptops_required++;
            }
        }
        return laptops_required;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_laptops(requirements):
    requirements.sort()
    laptops_required = 0
    for requirement in requirements:
        if requirement > laptops_required:
            laptops_required += 1
    return laptops_required
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int minLaptops(std::vector<int> requirements) {
    std::sort(requirements.begin(), requirements.end());
    int laptops_required = 0;
    for (int requirement : requirements) {
        if (requirement > laptops_required) {
            laptops_required++;
        }
    }
    return laptops_required;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minLaptops(requirements) {
    requirements.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let laptops_required = 0;
    for (let requirement of requirements) {
        if (requirement > laptops_required) {
            laptops_required++;
        }
    }
    return laptops_required;
}
```
