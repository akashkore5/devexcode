**Print With Space**
=====================

### Summary
This problem involves printing a given string with spaces in between each character. The key concept involved is manipulating strings, specifically inserting characters at specific positions.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to solve this problem is to iterate through the input string and print each character followed by a space. This can be achieved using a loop that iterates over the length of the input string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the output.
2. Iterate through the input string using a loop.
3. For each character in the input string, append the character followed by a space to the `result` string.
4. Return the `result` string.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: O(n), as we are storing the output string with n characters.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public static String printWithSpace(String str) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
        result.append(c).append(" ");
    }
    return result.toString().trim();
}
```
### Python
```python
def print_with_space(str):
    result = ""
    for c in str:
        result += c + " "
    return result.strip()
```
### C++
```cpp
#include <string>
std::string printWithSpace(const std::string& str) {
    std::string result;
    for (char c : str) {
        result += c + " ";
    }
    return result.substr(0, result.size() - 1); // remove trailing space
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function printWithSpace(str) {
    let result = "";
    for (let c of str) {
        result += c + " ";
    }
    return result.trim();
}
```
