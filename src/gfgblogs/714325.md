# Total Cuts

## Summary
The problem is about finding the total number of cuts that can be made in an array. The goal is to cut the array into two parts, and then recursively apply this process to each part until it's no longer possible to make any further cuts. This involves calculating prefix sums for each element in the array.

## Detailed Explanation
The algorithm starts by initializing a variable `totalCuts` to 0, which will store the total number of cuts made. Then, we iterate through the array from left to right, and for each element, calculate its prefix sum using the previously calculated prefix sums. If the current element is greater than its own prefix sum, it means that the previous elements in this part can be further cut, so we increment `totalCuts` by 1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize `totalCuts` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each element, calculate its prefix sum using the previously calculated prefix sums.
4. If the current element is greater than its own prefix sum, increment `totalCuts` by 1.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store `totalCuts`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int totalCuts(int[] arr) {
    int totalCuts = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int prefixSum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            prefixSum += arr[j];
        }
        if (arr[i] > prefixSum) {
            totalCuts++;
        }
    }
    return totalCuts;
}
```

### Python
```python
def total_cuts(arr):
    total_cuts = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        prefix_sum = sum(arr[:i+1])
        if arr[i] > prefix_sum:
            total_cuts += 1
    return total_cuts
```

### C++
```cpp
int totalCuts(int* arr, int n) {
    int totalCuts = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int prefixSum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            prefixSum += arr[j];
        }
        if (arr[i] > prefixSum) {
            totalCuts++;
        }
    }
    return totalCuts;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function totalCuts(arr) {
    let totalCuts = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let prefixSum = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            prefixSum += arr[j];
        }
        if (arr[i] > prefixSum) {
            totalCuts++;
        }
    }
    return totalCuts;
}
```
