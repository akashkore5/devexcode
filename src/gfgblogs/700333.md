# Find Maximum Value

## Summary

In this problem, we are given an array of integers and asked to find the maximum value in it. This problem involves basic algorithmic concepts such as arrays and comparison operations.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear scan through the array. We initialize our maximum value to the first element in the array, then iterate through the rest of the array, updating our maximum value whenever we find a larger one.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize `max` to the first element in the array.
2. Iterate through the rest of the array.
3. For each element, compare it to `max`. If it's greater, update `max`.
4. Return `max`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since we need to scan through all elements at least once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int findMaximum(int[] arr) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_maximum(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```

### C++
```cpp
int findMaximum(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findMaximum(arr) {
    let max = arr[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```
