**Display Longest Name**
===============

### Summary
Given an array of names, find and display the longest name. The problem requires understanding arrays and strings.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to this problem is straightforward: iterate through the array of names, compare the length of each name, and store the longest one. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize a variable `longest_name` to store the longest name found so far.
2. Iterate through the array of names using a for loop or any other suitable iteration method.
3. For each name in the array:
	* Calculate its length using the `length()` function (in languages that support it) or by manually counting characters.
	* Compare the length of the current name with the length of the longest name found so far (`longest_name`).
	* If the current name is longer, update `longest_name` to be the current name.
4. After iterating through all names, display the longest name found.

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of names in the array, since we need to iterate through each name once. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the longest name found.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class DisplayLongestName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] names = {"John", "Jane", "Jim", "Jessica"};
        String longest_name = "";
        for (String name : names) {
            if (name.length() > longest_name.length()) {
                longest_name = name;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The longest name is: " + longest_name);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def display_longest_name(names):
    longest_name = ""
    for name in names:
        if len(name) > len(longest_name):
            longest_name = name
    print("The longest name is:", longest_name)

names = ["John", "Jane", "Jim", "Jessica"]
display_longest_name(names)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void display_longest_name(std::string* names, int n) {
    std::string longest_name = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (names[i].length() > longest_name.length()) {
            longest_name = names[i];
        }
    }
    std::cout << "The longest name is: " << longest_name << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::string names[] = {"John", "Jane", "Jim", "Jessica"};
    int n = sizeof(names) / sizeof(names[0]);
    display_longest_name(names, n);
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function displayLongestName(names) {
    let longest_name = "";
    for (let name of names) {
        if (name.length > longest_name.length) {
            longest_name = name;
        }
    }
    console.log("The longest name is:", longest_name);
}

const names = ["John", "Jane", "Jim", "Jessica"];
displayLongestName(names);
```

Note that these solutions assume a simple comparison of name lengths. If you need to handle more complex cases (e.g., handling ties or non-ASCII characters), the approach may vary.
