### Summary
The Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm prioritizes the shortest job in the ready queue for execution. This problem requires calculating the average waiting time and turnaround time of a set of jobs scheduled using SJF.

### Detailed Explanation
To calculate the average waiting time and turnaround time, we need to first schedule the jobs using the SJF algorithm. The algorithm works by selecting the shortest job from the ready queue and executing it until its completion.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize variables: `n` is the number of jobs, `t_arr[i]` is the arrival time of job `i`, `t_burst[i]` is the burst time (execution time) of job `i`, and `w_time[i]` and `t_turn[i]` are the waiting time and turnaround time for job `i`, respectively.
2. Calculate the total waiting time (`total_w_time`) and turnaround time (`total_t_turn`).
3. Sort the jobs by their arrival times and then by their burst times (in ascending order). This is the ready queue.
4. Initialize the current time (`curr_time`) to 0.
5. Iterate through the ready queue:
   - For each job `i`, calculate its waiting time `w_time[i]` as the difference between its arrival time `t_arr[i]` and the current time `curr_time`.
   - Calculate its turnaround time `t_turn[i]` as the sum of its waiting time `w_time[i]` and its burst time `t_burst[i]`.
   - Update the current time (`curr_time`) to be the completion time of job `i`, which is the sum of its arrival time and its burst time.
6. Calculate the average waiting time (`avg_w_time`) as the total waiting time (`total_w_time`) divided by the number of jobs (`n`).
7. Calculate the average turnaround time (`avg_t_turn`) as the total turnaround time (`total_t_turn`) divided by the number of jobs (`n`).

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class SJFScheduling {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // number of jobs
        int[] t_arr = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}; // arrival times
        int[] t_burst = {3, 2, 7, 1, 4}; // burst times
        int total_w_time = 0;
        int total_t_turn = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int w_time = t_arr[i] + t_burst[i];
            int t_turn = w_time + t_burst[i];
            total_w_time += w_time;
            total_t_turn += t_turn;
        }

        double avg_w_time = (double) total_w_time / n;
        double avg_t_turn = (double) total_t_turn / n;

        System.out.println("Average waiting time: " + avg_w_time);
        System.out.println("Average turnaround time: " + avg_t_turn);
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def sjf_scheduling(n, t_arr, t_burst):
    total_w_time = 0
    total_t_turn = 0

    for i in range(n):
        w_time = t_arr[i] + t_burst[i]
        t_turn = w_time + t_burst[i]
        total_w_time += w_time
        total_t_turn += t_turn

    avg_w_time = total_w_time / n
    avg_t_turn = total_t_turn / n

    return avg_w_time, avg_t_turn

n = 5
t_arr = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
t_burst = [3, 2, 7, 1, 4]

avg_w_time, avg_t_turn = sjf_scheduling(n, t_arr, t_burst)

print("Average waiting time:", avg_w_time)
print("Average turnaround time:", avg_t_turn)
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

double sjfScheduling(int n, vector<int> t_arr, vector<int> t_burst) {
    double total_w_time = 0;
    double total_t_turn = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int w_time = t_arr[i] + t_burst[i];
        int t_turn = w_time + t_burst[i];
        total_w_time += w_time;
        total_t_turn += t_turn;
    }

    return total_w_time / n;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // number of jobs
    vector<int> t_arr = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}; // arrival times
    vector<int> t_burst = {3, 2, 7, 1, 4}; // burst times

    double avg_w_time = sjfScheduling(n, t_arr, t_burst);

    cout << "Average waiting time: " << avg_w_time << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function sjfScheduling(n, t_arr, t_burst) {
    let totalWTime = 0;
    let totalTTurn = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const wTime = t_arr[i] + t_burst[i];
        const tTurn = wTime + t_burst[i];
        totalWTime += wTime;
        totalTTurn += tTurn;
    }

    return [totalWTime / n, totalTTurn / n];
}

const n = 5;
const tArr = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6];
const tBurst = [3, 2, 7, 1, 4];

const [avgWT, avgTT] = sjfScheduling(n, tArr, tBurst);

console.log(`Average waiting time: ${avgWT}`);
console.log(`Average turnaround time: ${avgTT}`);
