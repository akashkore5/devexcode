**Area of a Circle**
=====================================================

## Summary
Find the area of a circle given its radius. This problem involves basic mathematical concepts and requires an understanding of the formula for calculating the area of a circle.

## Detailed Explanation
The formula to calculate the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. To solve this problem, we can use this formula and prompt the user to input the value of the radius.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  Prompt the user for the radius of the circle.
2.  Calculate the area using the formula A = πr^2.
3.  Print the calculated area.

Time complexity: O(1), as we are performing constant-time operations (input, calculation, and output).
Space complexity: O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
import java.lang.Math;

public class AreaOfACircle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double radius = Double.parseDouble(System.console().readLine("Enter the radius of the circle: "));
        double area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
        System.out.println("The area of the circle is " + area);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
import math

def calculate_area_of_circle():
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    print("The area of the circle is", area)

calculate_area_of_circle()
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    double radius;
    std::cout << "Enter the radius of the circle: ";
    std::cin >> radius;
    double area = M_PI * (radius * radius);
    std::cout << "The area of the circle is " << area << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function calculateAreaOfCircle() {
    let radius = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the radius of the circle: "));
    let area = Math.PI * (radius ** 2);
    console.log(`The area of the circle is ${area}`);
}

calculateAreaOfCircle();
```

Note that in each language, we are using a constant `π` or importing it from a math library.
