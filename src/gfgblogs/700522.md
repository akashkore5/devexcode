### Summary
Given a sorted array, we need to find the index at which a target element should be inserted to maintain the array's sort order. This problem involves searching and manipulating an array.

### Detailed Explanation
The given array is already sorted in ascending or descending order. To solve this problem, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the correct position for the target element. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the start and end of the array.
2. Calculate the middle index of the current subarray using the formula `(left + right) / 2`.
3. Compare the middle element with the target element:
	* If the target element is equal to the middle element, return the middle index as the correct position.
	* If the target element is less than the middle element, update `right` to the middle index - 1 and repeat steps 2-3.
	* If the target element is greater than the middle element, update `left` to the middle index + 1 and repeat steps 2-3.
4. Continue this process until `left` and `right` converge or cross over each other.
5. The correct position for the target element is the final value of `left`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), where n is the length of the array, since we are dividing the search space in half at each step. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the target element.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int operatingArray(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def operating_array(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left
```

#### C++
```cpp
int operatingArray(int* arr, int target, int n) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function operatingArray(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

Note that the above solutions are optimized to find the correct position for the target element in a sorted array.
