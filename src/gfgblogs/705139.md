**Minimum Value Assigned**
======================

## Summary
Given an array of integers, assign a minimum value to all elements in the array. This problem involves basic array manipulation and is categorized under "Arrays" and "Data Structures".

## Detailed Explanation
The given problem can be solved by iterating through the array and assigning each element with the minimum value found so far. We keep track of this minimum value as we iterate through the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize a variable `min_value` to store the minimum value.
2. Iterate through the array. For each element:
   - Compare the current element with `min_value`.
   - If the current element is smaller, update `min_value` to be this new minimum.
3. After iterating through the entire array, all elements should have been assigned the minimum value.

Here's a simple ASCII art diagram representing the process:

```
 Initial Array: [5, 2, 8, 1]
 min_value = 5

 Iteration:
 - Compare 5 with 5 (no update)
 - Compare 2 with 5 (update min_value to 2)
 - Compare 8 with 2 (no update)
 - Compare 1 with 2 (update min_value to 1)

 Final Array: [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

Time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public class MinimumValueAssigned {
    public static void assignMin(int[] arr) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (i < min) {
                min = i;
            }
        }
        for (int i : arr) {
            arr[i] = min;
        }
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
def assign_min(arr):
    min_val = float('inf')
    for num in arr:
        if num < min_val:
            min_val = num
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i] = min_val
```
### C++
```cpp
void assignMin(int* arr, int n) {
    int min = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] < min) {
            min = arr[i];
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = min;
    }
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function assignMin(arr) {
    let min = Infinity;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num < min) {
            min = num;
        }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        arr[i] = min;
    }
}
```
