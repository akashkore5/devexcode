**Minimum Distance between Two Points**
==============================

### Summary
Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), find the minimum distance between them. This problem can be approached by using the Euclidean distance formula.

### Detailed Explanation
The minimum distance between two points in a 2D space is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, which is given as:

√((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

To find this distance, we first calculate the differences in x and y coordinates. Then, we square these differences and add them together. Finally, we take the square root of the sum to get the Euclidean distance.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  Calculate the difference in x-coordinates: `dx = x2 - x1`
2.  Calculate the difference in y-coordinates: `dy = y2 - y1`
3.  Square these differences: `dx^2 = dx * dx` and `dy^2 = dy * dy`
4.  Add the squares of the differences: `distance_squared = dx^2 + dy^2`
5.  Calculate the square root of the sum: `distance = √distance_squared`

The time complexity for this solution is O(1), as we are only performing a few constant operations. The space complexity is also O(1), as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x1 = 1;
        double y1 = 2;
        double x2 = 4;
        double y2 = 6;

        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;
        double distanceSquared = Math.pow(dx, 2) + Math.pow(dy, 2);
        double distance = Math.sqrt(distanceSquared);

        System.out.println("The minimum distance is: " + distance);
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def min_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    distance_squared = dx ** 2 + dy ** 2
    distance = math.sqrt(distance_squared)

    return distance

x1, y1, x2, y2 = 1, 2, 4, 6
print("The minimum distance is:", min_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2))
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

double findMinDistance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
    double dx = x2 - x1;
    double dy = y2 - y1;
    double distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
    double distance = sqrt(distanceSquared);

    return distance;

int main() {
    double x1 = 1.0;
    double y1 = 2.0;
    double x2 = 4.0;
    double y2 = 6.0;
    std::cout << "The minimum distance is: " << findMinDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function minDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
    let dx = x2 - x1;
    let dy = y2 - y1;
    let distanceSquared = Math.pow(dx, 2) + Math.pow(dy, 2);
    let distance = Math.sqrt(distanceSquared);

    return distance;

let x1 = 1;
let y1 = 2;
let x2 = 4;
let y2 = 6;
console.log("The minimum distance is:", minDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2));
```
