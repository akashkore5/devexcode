**Capitalize and Count**
=====================

## Summary
The problem, "Capitalize and Count", involves processing a given string by capitalizing each word and counting the total number of occurrences. This task requires applying basic string manipulation techniques and practicing attention to detail.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start by splitting the input string into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter. We then iterate through each word, converting it to uppercase using Python's built-in `upper()` method or Java's `toUpperCase()` method. This process effectively capitalizes each word in the original string.

Next, we count the total number of occurrences by keeping a running tally of unique words. Since we're capitalizing each word, identical words become distinct after conversion (e.g., "hello" and "Hello" are counted separately). To maintain efficiency, we can use a dictionary or hash set to keep track of encountered words.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  Split the input string into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter.
2.  Iterate through each word and convert it to uppercase using `upper()` (Python) or `toUpperCase()` (Java).
3.  Count the total number of occurrences by maintaining a running tally of unique words.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we iterate through each character once.
**Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of unique words in the input string, since we store these words in a dictionary or hash set.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int capitalizeAndCount(String s) {
    String[] words = s.split("\\s+");
    Set<String> uniqueWords = new HashSet<>();
    
    for (String word : words) {
        String capitalizedWord = word.toUpperCase();
        if (!uniqueWords.add(capitalizedWord)) {
            return -1; // or handle this situation as desired
        }
    }
    
    return uniqueWords.size();
}
```
### Python
```python
def capitalize_and_count(s):
    words = s.split()
    unique_words = set()
    
    for word in words:
        capitalized_word = word.upper()
        if capitalized_word not in unique_words:
            unique_words.add(capitalized_word)
    
    return len(unique_words)
```
### C++
```cpp
int capitalizeAndCount(const std::string& s) {
    std::vector<std::string> words;
    std::istringstream iss(s);
    
    for (std::string word; std::getline(iss, word, ' '); ++word) {
        std::transform(word.begin(), word.end(), word.begin(), ::toupper);
        if (std::find_if(words.begin(), words.end(), [&word](const std::string& w){ return w == word; }) != words.end()) {
            // or handle this situation as desired
        } else {
            words.push_back(word);
        }
    }
    
    return words.size();
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function capitalizeAndCount(s) {
    const words = s.split(' ');
    let uniqueWords = new Set();
    
    for (const word of words) {
        const capitalizedWord = word.toUpperCase();
        if (!uniqueWords.has(capitalizedWord)) {
            uniqueWords.add(capitalizedWord);
        }
    }
    
    return uniqueWords.size;
}
```
Note: The optimized solutions provided in different languages may vary depending on specific problem requirements. For example, some problems might require handling null or undefined values differently.
