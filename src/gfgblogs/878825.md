# Check for Disjoint Sets or Arrays

## Summary
The problem "Check for Disjoint" involves determining whether two given arrays are disjoint. A set of elements is considered disjoint if it contains no common elements with another set. In this problem, we need to write an algorithm that checks if the given arrays contain any common elements.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach by iterating through each element in both arrays and checking for any common elements. If we find any common elements, we know the arrays are not disjoint and return false. If we don't find any common elements after checking all elements, we know the arrays are disjoint and return true.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of both arrays.
2. Iterate through both arrays until one array is exhausted:
   - For each element in the first array, check if it exists in the second array by iterating through the second array using a pointer `k`.
   - If an element is found in the second array, return false because the arrays are not disjoint.
   - If no common elements are found after checking all elements in both arrays, return true because the arrays are disjoint.

Here's a diagram illustrating this approach:
```
  Array 1: [a, b, c]
  Array 2: [d, e, f]

  i = 0, j = 0
  |       |
  |   a    |
  |       |
  k = 0, check if a exists in array 2 (no)
  i = 1, j = 0
  |       |
  |   b    |
  |       |
  k = 0, check if b exists in array 2 (no)
  i = 2, j = 0
  |       |
  |   c    |
  |       |
  k = 0, check if c exists in array 2 (no)

  No common elements found. Return true.
```

Time complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the arrays.
Space complexity: O(1) because we only use a few extra variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public boolean checkDisjoint(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Python
```python
def check_disjoint(arr1, arr2):
    for elem in arr1:
        if elem in arr2:
            return False
    return True
```

### C++
```cpp
bool checkDisjoint(int* arr1, int size1, int* arr2, int size2) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size2; j++) {
            if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function checkDisjoint(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            if (arr1[i] === arr2[j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
