Here is the detailed Markdown blog post for the "Row Sum in a Matrix" problem:

# Row Sum in a Matrix
## Summary
Given a matrix, find the sum of each row. This problem involves basic array manipulation and no complex algorithms are needed.

## Detailed Explanation
The solution to this problem is quite simple. We just need to iterate over each row in the matrix, add up all the elements in that row, and store the result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* Iterate over each row in the matrix.
* For each row, initialize a variable `row_sum` to 0.
* Iterate over each element in the current row.
* Add the value of the current element to `row_sum`.
* After iterating over all elements in the current row, print or return `row_sum`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram representing the matrix and the process:
```
Matrix: [[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6],
         [7, 8, 9]]

Row Sum Calculation:
  Row 1: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  Row 2: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  Row 3: 7 + 8 + 9 = 24

Result: [6, 15, 24]
```
The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. The space complexity is O(1) as we only need a constant amount of extra space to store `row_sum`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int[] rowSums(int[][] matrix) {
    int[][] result = new int[matrix.length][];
    for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
            sum += matrix[i][j];
        }
        result[i] = new int[]{sum};
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Python
```python
def row_sums(matrix):
    return [[sum(row)] for row in matrix]
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> rowSums(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].size(); j++) {
            sum += matrix[i][j];
        }
        result.push_back({sum});
    }
    return result;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function rowSums(matrix) {
    return matrix.map(row => [row.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)]);
}
```
Note that the optimized solutions are just variations of the basic algorithm and do not significantly improve the time or space complexity.
