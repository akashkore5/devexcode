## Summary
The Count Digits problem requires you to write a program that takes an integer as input and returns the number of digits in that integer. This problem involves basic arithmetic operations and is a great exercise in understanding how to manipulate integers.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the integer until it reaches zero. In each iteration, we can increment a counter variable for each digit present in the number. We can achieve this by using the modulo operator (`%`) to get the remainder of the division of the number by 10. This will give us the last digit of the number.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will store the total count of digits.
2. While the input integer is greater than 0:
   - Get the last digit of the number by using the modulo operator (`%`) with 10 as the divisor.
   - Increment the `count` variable by 1 for each non-zero digit found.
   - Update the number by performing integer division by 10 to move to the next digit.
3. Return the total count of digits.

Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the input integer, because we are essentially dividing the number by 10 in each iteration until it reaches zero.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static int countDigits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            n /= 10;
            if (n != 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(countDigits(123)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_digits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        n //= 10
        if n != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

print(count_digits(123))  # Output: 3
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int countDigits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        n /= 10;
        if (n != 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;

}

int main() {
    std::cout << countDigits(123) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countDigits(n) {
    let count = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        n = Math.floor(n / 10);
        if (n !== 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;

}

console.log(countDigits(123)); // Output: 3
```
