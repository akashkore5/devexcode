**The Else if Statement**
=====================================================

### Summary
The else if statement is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to perform specific actions based on multiple conditions. This problem requires you to implement an algorithm using the else if statement to achieve a specific outcome.

### Detailed Explanation
The else if statement is used when you need to check for multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code for each condition. In this problem, we will use the else if statement to solve a classic programming problem.

Let's consider the following scenario: You are given an integer N, and you need to print all numbers from 1 to N that are not divisible by either 3 or 5.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Initialize a variable `i` to 1.
* Use a loop to iterate until `i` is greater than N.
* Inside the loop, use an else if statement to check if `i` is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is, print "Not a multiple" and increment `i`.
* If `i` is not divisible by either 3 or 5, print `i` and increment `i`.

This solution uses the else if statement to achieve the desired outcome.

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)

### Optimized Solutions
#### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 20; // change this value as needed
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def print_numbers(N):
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        if i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 != 0:
            print(i)

N = 20  # change this value as needed
print_numbers(N)
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N = 20; // change this value as needed
    for(int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
        if(i%3!=0 && i%5!=0) {
            cout<<i<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function printNumbers(N) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (i % 3 !== 0 && i % 5 !== 0) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
}

const N = 20; // change this value as needed
printNumbers(N);
```

Note that the optimized solutions are just examples and can be improved further based on the specific requirements of the problem.
