**Minimize Cash Flow**
=====================

### Summary

The Minimize Cash Flow problem involves minimizing a given cash flow by moving some of it to another account. The goal is to minimize the difference between two amounts, one in each account. This problem requires an understanding of dynamic programming and optimization techniques.

### Detailed Explanation

We are given a series of transactions where we need to keep track of the amount of money in our accounts. For each transaction, we can either move some cash from one account to another or leave it as is. The goal is to minimize the difference between the amounts in both accounts.

The dynamic programming approach involves creating a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum difference when we have processed the first `i` transactions and the current balance in each account is `j`. For each transaction, we calculate the new balances in both accounts and update our table accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty table `dp` with dimensions `(transactions + 1) x (max_balance + 1)` where `transactions` is the number of transactions and `max_balance` is the maximum balance in either account.
2. Iterate through each transaction:
	* For each transaction, calculate the new balances in both accounts by adding/subtracting the transaction amount from the current balances.
	* Update our table `dp` with the minimum difference when we have processed this transaction and the new balances are `j`.
3. Return the minimum difference found in the last row of the table.

Here's a sample diagram representing the transactions:
```
  +---------------+
  |  Transaction  |
  +---------------+
  | 0 | 100 | 50 |
  +---------------+
  | 1 | 150 | 75 |
  +---------------+
  | 2 | 180 | 90 |
  +---------------+
  ...
```

Time complexity: O(transactions \* max_balance)
Space complexity: O(transactions \* max_balance)

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int minimizeCashFlow(int[] transactions) {
    int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < transactions.length - 1; i++) {
        int newBalance1 = 100 + transactions[i];
        int newBalance2 = 50 - transactions[i];
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(newBalance1 - newBalance2));
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def minimize_cash_flow(transactions):
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(transactions) - 1):
        new_balance1 = 100 + transactions[i]
        new_balance2 = 50 - transactions[i]
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(new_balance1 - new_balance2))
    return min_diff
```

#### C++
```cpp
int minimizeCashFlow(int* transactions, int length) {
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
        int newBalance1 = 100 + transactions[i];
        int newBalance2 = 50 - transactions[i];
        minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(newBalance1 - newBalance2));
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function minimizeCashFlow(transactions) {
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < transactions.length - 1; i++) {
        let newBalance1 = 100 + transactions[i];
        let newBalance2 = 50 - transactions[i];
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(newBalance1 - newBalance2));
    }
    return minDiff;
}
```

Note: In the optimized solutions, we assume that the initial balance in both accounts is 100. If this is not the case, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.
