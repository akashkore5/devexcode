Here is the detailed Markdown blog post for the "For-Each Loop" problem:

# For-Each Loop
## Summary
The problem involves implementing a for-each loop to iterate over a collection of elements. The key concept involved is iteration over a data structure, such as an array or list.

## Detailed Explanation
A for-each loop is used to iterate over a collection of elements without the need to manually keep track of an index variable. This type of loop is particularly useful when working with collections like arrays, lists, or maps.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
```markdown
 1. Define the loop variable: Start by defining the variable that will be used to store each element in the collection.
 2. Initialize the loop variable: Set the initial value for the loop variable.
 3. Iterate over the collection: Use a for-each loop to iterate over the elements in the collection.
 4. Process each element: Inside the loop, process each element as needed (e.g., print it, modify it, etc.).
```
For example, if we have an array of integers and want to print out each integer:

```markdown
 1. Define the loop variable: `int num`
 2. Initialize the loop variable: `num = 0` (assuming the array starts at index 0)
 3. Iterate over the collection: `for (int num : nums) { ... }` where `nums` is the array of integers
 4. Process each element: `System.out.println(num);`
```

Time complexity analysis:
* The time complexity of a for-each loop is O(n), where n is the size of the collection.

Space complexity analysis:
* The space complexity of a for-each loop is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of extra memory to store the loop variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ForEachLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int num : nums) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in nums:
    print(num)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::cout << num << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let num of nums) {
    console.log(num);
}
```
