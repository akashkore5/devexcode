**Remove from Vector**
=====================================

## Summary
Given a vector and an integer, remove all occurrences of that integer from the vector. This problem is about manipulating a vector (a dynamic array) using Standard Template Library (STL) algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the vector and removing elements that match the given integer. We'll use the `erase` method to remove elements, which returns an iterator pointing to the element following the removed one.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Iterate through the vector using an iterator.
2. For each element, check if it matches the given integer.
3. If it does, use the `erase` method to remove that element from the vector. This will shift all subsequent elements down by one position.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the vector is reached.

Time complexity analysis: O(n), where n is the size of the vector, because we're iterating through each element once.

Space complexity analysis: O(1), because we're not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public static void removeFromVector(int[] arr, int num) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == num) {
            arr = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 0, i);
            arr = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, i + 1, arr.length);
            i--; // adjust the loop variable
        }
    }
}
```
### Python
```python
def remove_from_vector(vector, num):
    vector[:] = [x for x in vector if x != num]
```
### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void removeFromVector(std::vector<int>& vec, int num) {
    auto it = std::remove_if(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [num](int x) { return x == num; });
    vec.erase(it, vec.end());
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function removeFromVector(arr, num) {
    arr = arr.filter(x => x !== num);
}
```
Note that the optimized solutions in Java and C++ use a different approach by creating new arrays with the desired elements, whereas Python's solution uses list comprehension to create a new list. The JavaScript solution uses the `filter` method to achieve the same result.
