**Set bits in N**
===============

## Summary
Given a positive integer `N`, write an algorithm to count the number of set bits (bits that are equal to 1) in the binary representation of `N`. This problem involves understanding the concept of bitwise operations and manipulation.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple bitwise operation. The idea is to use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to find the set bits in the binary representation of `N`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `set_bits` to 0.
2. Loop through each bit in the binary representation of `N`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost).
3. For each bit, use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) with the current bit and the number 1. This will give us a result that is either 0 (if the bit is not set) or 1 (if the bit is set).
4. If the result is non-zero, increment `set_bits` by 1.
5. After looping through all bits, return the value of `set_bits`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram to illustrate this process:
```
    N: 11001010
    ^         ^
    |         |
    v         v
  1 & 1 = 1  // set bit
  0 & 1 = 0  // not a set bit
  ...
  0 & 1 = 0  // not a set bit
```
Time complexity: O(log N) (where `N` is the input integer)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int countSetBits(int n) {
    int set_bits = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        if ((n & 1) == 1) {
            set_bits++;
        }
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return set_bits;
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_set_bits(n):
    set_bits = 0
    while n:
        if n & 1:
            set_bits += 1
        n >>= 1
    return set_bits
```

### C++
```cpp
int countSetBits(int n) {
    int set_bits = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        if ((n & 1) == 1) {
            set_bits++;
        }
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return set_bits;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countSetBits(n) {
    let set_bits = 0;
    while (n) {
        if (n & 1) {
            set_bits++;
        }
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return set_bits;
}
```
