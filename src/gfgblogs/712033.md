**Pattern 16**
======================================

**Slug:** triangle-pattern-1662285334
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Id:** 712033

## Summary

This problem is about generating a specific pattern involving triangles. The goal is to print a right-angled triangle with asterisks (*) in a specific format, where the number of rows and columns increases by one for each subsequent row. This requires a basic understanding of loops and conditional statements.

## Detailed Explanation

To generate this pattern, we'll use nested loops to control the placement of asterisks. The outer loop will handle the rows, while the inner loop will handle the columns within each row.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an integer variable `rows` to 1 (the starting number of rows).
2. Use a loop to iterate through each row:
   - For each row, use another loop to print spaces and asterisks.
     - Print the number of spaces equal to the current row number minus one (to create the right angle).
     - Then, print the number of asterisks equal to the current row number.
3. Increment `rows` by 1 for each iteration.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int rows = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
            rows++;
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def main():
    rows = 1
    while True:
        for i in range(rows):
            print("*" * (i + 1))
        rows += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int rows = 1;
    while (true) {
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                cout << "*";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
        rows++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function main() {
    let rows = 1;
    while (true) {
        for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                process.stdout.write("*");
            }
            process.stdout.write("\n");
        }
        rows++;
    }

}

main();
```

Note: These solutions assume that the user wants to generate an infinite triangle. In a real-world scenario, you would want to provide a way for the user to specify the number of rows they want in the triangle.
