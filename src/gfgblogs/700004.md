**Print Linked List**

## Summary
The problem is about printing the elements of a linked list. The key concepts involved are linked lists and basic data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The given problem statement does not provide any specific information about how to print the linked list, but based on the difficulty level and topic tags, we can assume that we need to write an algorithm to traverse the linked list and print its elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start at the head node of the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list by moving from one node to the next until you reach the end of the list (i.e., until the `next` pointer of the current node is `NULL`).
3. For each node, print its value.

Here's a simple ASCII art diagram illustrating the algorithm:

```
Head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> ... -> NodeN
```

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space complexity: O(1), since we only need to keep track of the current node and don't require any additional space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public void printLinkedList(Node head) {
    Node current = head;
    while (current != null) {
        System.out.print(current.val + " ");
        current = current.next;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        print(current.value, end=" ")
        current = current.next
```

### C++
```cpp
void printLinkedList(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        std::cout << current->val << " ";
        current = current->next;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function printLinkedList(head) {
    let current = head;
    while (current !== null) {
        console.log(current.val + " ");
        current = current.next;
    }
}
```
