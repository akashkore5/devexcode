**Bitwise Right Shift**
=====================

## Summary
The problem involves performing a bitwise right shift operation on a given number. The goal is to shift the bits of the number to the right by a specified number of positions, filling with zeros if necessary.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the bitwise right shift operator (>>) in programming languages that support it (such as Java, C++, and JavaScript). This operator shifts the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, if we have a binary number 1010 and we want to shift it to the right by 2 positions, the result would be 0010.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Take an integer as input.
2. Calculate the bitwise right shift of the integer using the >> operator in your chosen programming language.
3. Return the shifted value.

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int bitwiseRightShift(int n, int positions) {
    return n >>> positions;
}
```
### Python
```python
def bitwise_right_shift(n, positions):
    return n >> positions
```
### C++
```cpp
int bitwiseRightShift(int n, int positions) {
    return n >> positions;
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function bitwiseRightShift(n, positions) {
    return n >>> positions;
}
```
Note that the >>> operator in Java is used for unsigned right shift, whereas the >> operator performs signed right shift. The other languages do not have a specific unsigned right shift operator, but they all perform signed right shift by default.
