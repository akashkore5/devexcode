# Find Kth Rotation

## Summary
Given an array of size n and a value k, find the kth rotation in the array. The kth rotation is the element at index (k % n) - 1. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3] and k = 2, the 2nd rotation would be the second element, which is 2.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simply calculate the kth rotation by using the modulo operator to ensure that the index stays within the bounds of the array. We then return the element at that index.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Calculate the kth rotation by taking the modulus of k with the size of the array (n).
2. Subtract 1 from the result to get the correct index, since array indices start from 0.
3. Return the element at the calculated index.

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int findKthRotation(int[] arr, int k) {
    return arr[(k % arr.length) - 1];
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_kth_rotation(arr, k):
    return arr[(k % len(arr)) - 1]
```

### C++
```cpp
int findKthRotation(int* arr, int n, int k) {
    return arr[(k % n) - 1];
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findKthRotation(arr, k) {
    return arr[(k % arr.length) - 1];
}
```
