## Summary
Given an array of integers, find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The problem requires you to identify the pair with the largest absolute difference and return its indices.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach involving sorting the array and then iterating through it to find the maximum difference. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Sort the input array in ascending order.
2. Initialize two variables: `max_diff` to store the maximum difference found so far, and `index1` and `index2` to store the indices of the pair with the largest absolute difference.
3. Iterate through the sorted array, considering each pair of adjacent elements.
4. Calculate the absolute difference between the current element and the previous one.
5. If the calculated difference is greater than `max_diff`, update `max_diff` and set `index1` to the index of the previous element and `index2` to the current index.
6. Continue iterating until the end of the array, and return `index1` and `index2` as the indices of the pair with the maximum difference.

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] maxDifference(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int max_diff = 0;
        int index1 = -1, index2 = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1]);
            if (diff > max_diff) {
                max_diff = diff;
                index1 = i - 1;
                index2 = i;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{index1, index2};
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def max_difference(arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_diff = 0
    index1 = -1; index2 = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1])
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
            index1 = i - 1
            index2 = i
    return [index1, index2]
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int* maxDifference(int* arr, int n) {
        sort(arr, arr + n);
        int max_diff = 0;
        int index1 = -1; int index2 = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1]);
            if (diff > max_diff) {
                max_diff = diff;
                index1 = i - 1;
                index2 = i;
            }
        }
        return new int[2]{index1, index2};
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxDifference(arr) {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let max_diff = 0;
    let index1 = -1; let index2 = -1;
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1]);
        if (diff > max_diff) {
            max_diff = diff;
            index1 = i - 1;
            index2 = i;
        }
    }
    return [index1, index2];
}
```
