## Summary
The Sum Array Puzzle is a basic algorithm problem that involves finding the sum of all array elements. Given an array of integers, you need to write a program that calculates the total sum of all elements in the array. This problem requires understanding of basic mathematical operations and array manipulation.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We will initialize a variable `sum` to 0 and then iterate through each element in the array, adding it to our running total. Finally, we return the calculated sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element, add its value to the `sum`.
4. Return the final value of `sum`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating through each element once.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space to store our running total.

Here's an example diagram illustrating the process:
```
sum = 0
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for each element in array:
    sum += element
return sum

initially: sum = 0
after adding 1: sum = 1
after adding 2: sum = 3
after adding 3: sum = 6
after adding 4: sum = 10
after adding 5: sum = 15
```

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int sumArray(int[] array) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int element : array) {
        sum += element;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Python
```python
def sum_array(array):
    sum = 0
    for element in array:
        sum += element
    return sum
```

### C++
```cpp
int sumArray(int* array, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumArray(array) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let element of array) {
        sum += element;
    }
    return sum;
}
```
