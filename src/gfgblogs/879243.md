## Summary
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming that helps us manage complexity by hiding implementation details and only exposing necessary information. This problem focuses on implementing abstraction in Python, which is essential for writing reusable and maintainable code.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem requires you to define an abstract class `AbstractClass` with two methods: `public abstract void abstractMethod()` and `public void concreteMethod()`. The `abstractMethod()` should be declared as abstract, meaning it must be implemented by any subclass. On the other hand, `concreteMethod()` is a concrete method that can be overridden or left unmodified in subclasses.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1.  Define an abstract class `AbstractClass` with two methods: `public abstract void abstractMethod()` and `public void concreteMethod()`.
2.  In the `concreteMethod()`, you can perform any necessary operations or calculations.
3.  Create a subclass that inherits from `AbstractClass`. This subclass should override the `abstractMethod()` to provide its own implementation.

Here's an example of how this could look in Python:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClass(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        print("Abstract class initialized")

    @abstractmethod
    def abstractMethod(self):
        pass

    def concreteMethod(self):
        print("Concrete method called")


class Subclass(AbstractClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("Subclass initialized")

    def abstractMethod(self):
        print("Abstract method overridden in subclass")
```
Time complexity analysis: O(1), as the methods do not involve any loops or recursive calls.

Space complexity analysis: O(1), since there is no extra space used that scales with input size.
