## Summary
The Winterfell kingdom is in danger. A dragon is approaching the castle and will destroy it if it's not saved within a certain time frame. The king has a list of wizards who can help save the kingdom, but they are located at different distances from the castle. Each wizard has a specific distance he or she can travel to help save the kingdom. Your task is to find out which wizard can save the kingdom in the least amount of time.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate over each wizard and check if they can reach Winterfell before the dragon does. We keep track of the minimum distance required to save the kingdom. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Initialize `min_distance` to infinity.
* Iterate over each wizard:
	+ Calculate the distance from the wizard's location to Winterfell.
	+ Check if this distance is less than or equal to `min_distance`.
	+ If it is, update `min_distance` with this new value.
* Return `min_distance`, which is the minimum time required to save the kingdom.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the problem:
```
  +---------------+
  | Wizard A     |
  | (distance: 3) |
  +---------------+
  | Wizard B     |
  | (distance: 5) |
  +---------------+
  | ...          |
  +---------------+
  | Winterfell    |
  | (target)      |
  +---------------+
```
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of wizards. Space complexity: O(1).

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int saveWinterfell(int[] wizardDistances) {
    int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int distance : wizardDistances) {
        if (distance <= minDistance) {
            minDistance = distance;
        }
    }
    return minDistance;
}
```

### Python
```python
def save_winterfell(wizard_distances):
    min_distance = float('inf')
    for distance in wizard_distances:
        if distance <= min_distance:
            min_distance = distance
    return min_distance
```

### C++
```cpp
int saveWinterfell(int* wizardDistances, int numWizards) {
    int minDistance = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < numWizards; i++) {
        if (wizardDistances[i] <= minDistance) {
            minDistance = wizardDistances[i];
        }
    }
    return minDistance;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function saveWinterfell(wizardDistances) {
    let minDistance = Infinity;
    for (let distance of wizardDistances) {
        if (distance <= minDistance) {
            minDistance = distance;
        }
    }
    return minDistance;
}
```

Note: The `INT_MAX` constant is used in the C++ solution to represent the maximum possible integer value.
