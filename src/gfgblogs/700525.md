**Linked List Insertion At End**

## Summary
Inserting a new node at the end of a singly linked list is a fundamental operation in data structures. Given the head of the linked list and the value to be inserted, we need to update the list by adding the new node as the last element.

This problem requires understanding of basic linked list concepts, including node structure, insertion, and traversal.

## Detailed Explanation
The solution involves creating a new node with the given value and updating the existing nodes in the list. We start by traversing the list until we reach the last node (or the end of the list). Once we find the last node, we update its `next` pointer to point to the new node.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Start at the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the list until you reach the last node (i.e., `current->next == NULL`).
3. Create a new node with the given value.
4. Update the `next` pointer of the last node to point to the new node.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the linked list.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the new node and traversal variables.

## Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public Node insertAtEnd(Node head, int val) {
    Node newNode = new Node(val);
    if (head == null) {
        return newNode;
    }
    Node current = head;
    while (current.next != null) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
    return head;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def insert_at_end(head, val):
    new_node = Node(val)
    if head is None:
        return new_node
    current = head
    while current.next is not None:
        current = current.next
    current.next = new_node
    return head
```

#### C++
```cpp
Node* insertAtEnd(Node* head, int val) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(val);
    if (head == NULL) {
        return newNode;
    }
    Node* current = head;
    while (current->next != NULL) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    current->next = newNode;
    return head;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function insertAtEnd(head, val) {
    const newNode = { value: val, next: null };
    if (head === null) {
        return newNode;
    }
    let current = head;
    while (current.next !== null) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
    return head;
}
```

These solutions create a new node with the given value and update the existing nodes in the list to insert it at the end.
