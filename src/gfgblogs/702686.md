### Summary
Given a list of buildings and their respective elevations, we need to determine which buildings receive direct sunlight. A building receives direct sunlight if the elevation of that building is higher than or equal to any building that comes after it in the list.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of buildings from left to right. For each building, we check if its elevation is greater than or equal to the elevation of any subsequent building. If it is, then we consider this building as receiving direct sunlight and mark it accordingly. We keep track of the last index where we found a building that receives direct sunlight. If no such building is found, then all buildings receive direct sunlight.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty array `sunlightReceivers` to store the indices of buildings that receive direct sunlight.
2. Iterate through the list of buildings from left to right.
3. For each building, check if its elevation is greater than or equal to the elevation of any subsequent building.
4. If it is, add the current index to `sunlightReceivers` and update the last index where we found a building that receives direct sunlight.
5. Return the length of `sunlightReceivers`, which represents the number of buildings that receive direct sunlight.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int countSunlightReceivers(int[] elevations) {
    int sunlightReceivers = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < elevations.length; i++) {
        boolean receivesDirectSunlight = true;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < elevations.length; j++) {
            if (elevations[i] <= elevations[j]) {
                receivesDirectSunlight = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (receivesDirectSunlight) {
            sunlightReceivers++;
        }
    }
    return sunlightReceivers;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def count_sunlight_receivers(elevations):
    sunlight_receivers = 0
    for i in range(len(elevations)):
        receives_direct_sunlight = True
        for j in range(i + 1, len(elevations)):
            if elevations[i] <= elevations[j]:
                receives_direct_sunlight = False
                break
        if receives_direct_sunlight:
            sunlight_receivers += 1
    return sunlight_receivers
```

#### C++
```cpp
int countSunlightReceivers(int* elevations, int length) {
    int sunlightReceivers = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        bool receivesDirectSunlight = true;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
            if (elevations[i] <= elevations[j]) {
                receivesDirectSunlight = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (receivesDirectSunlight) {
            sunlightReceivers++;
        }
    }
    return sunlightReceivers;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function countSunlightReceivers(elevations) {
    let sunlightReceivers = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < elevations.length; i++) {
        let receivesDirectSunlight = true;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < elevations.length; j++) {
            if (elevations[i] <= elevations[j]) {
                receivesDirectSunlight = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (receivesDirectSunlight) {
            sunlightReceivers++;
        }
    }
    return sunlightReceivers;
}
