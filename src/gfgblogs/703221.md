**Last Index of One**
==================================================================

### Summary

Given an array of integers, find the last index at which a `1` appears. This problem requires searching through the array to identify the last occurrence of a specific element (in this case, the number `1`). The key concepts involved are arrays and searching.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from right to left (i.e., starting from the end). We keep track of the index at which the last `1` is found. If no `1` is found in the array, we return `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `last_index` to `-1`.
2. Iterate through the array from right to left.
3. For each element, check if it is equal to `1`. If it is:
   * Update `last_index` with the current index.
4. After iterating through the entire array, return `last_index`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `last_index` variable.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int lastIndexOne(int[] arr) {
    int last_index = -1;
    for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            last_index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    return last_index;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def last_index_one(arr):
    last_index = -1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            last_index = i
            break
    return last_index
```

#### C++
```cpp
int lastIndexOne(int* arr, int n) {
    int last_index = -1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            last_index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    return last_index;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function lastIndexOne(arr) {
    let last_index = -1;
    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] === 1) {
            last_index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    return last_index;
}
```
