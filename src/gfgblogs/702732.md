# Sum of Natural Numbers

## Summary

This problem involves calculating the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n. The key concept involved is the mathematical series, and the goal is to develop an efficient algorithm to compute the sum.

## Detailed Explanation

The sum of natural numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using a simple formula: `n*(n+1)/2`. This formula is based on the mathematical property that the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Calculate the value of `n`.
2. Use the formula `n*(n+1)/2` to calculate the sum of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class SumOfNaturalNumbers {
    public static int calculateSum(int n) {
        return n * (n + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def sum_of_natural_numbers(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int calculateSum(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    std::cout << "The sum of natural numbers from 1 to " << n << " is: " << calculateSum(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumOfNaturalNumbers(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

console.log("The sum of natural numbers from 1 to 10 is:", sumOfNaturalNumbers(10));
```
