**Swap Values using pointers**
==================================================

## Summary
The problem is about swapping two values in C++ using pointers. The goal is to swap the values without using the built-in `swap` function or temporary variables.

## Detailed Explanation
In this problem, we are given two integer values and asked to swap them without using any extra space. We can achieve this by using pointers in C++. This approach takes advantage of pointer arithmetic to swap the values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Take two integer values `a` and `b`.
2. Create two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, which point to `a` and `b` respectively.
3. Swap the values at the memory locations pointed by `p1` and `p2`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram of the step:

```
  a (int) | p1
  ---------
  b (int) | p2
```

Swap:
```
  b (int) | p1
  ---------
  a (int) | p2
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only involves swapping two values. The space complexity is also O(1), as we don't use any extra space.

## Optimized Solutions

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void swap(int* a, int* b) {
    int t = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = t;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;

    std::cout << "Before swapping: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;

    swap(&a, &b);

    std::cout << "After swapping: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 10};
        System.out.println("Before swapping: a = " + arr[0] + ", b = " + arr[1]);

        swap(arr, 0, 1);

        System.out.println("After swapping: a = " + arr[0] + ", b = " + arr[1]);
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def swap(a, b):
    return b, a

a, b = 5, 10

print("Before swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)

b, a = swap(a, b)

print("After swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function swap(arr, i, j) {
    let temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = temp;
}

let arr = [5, 10];
console.log("Before swapping: a =", arr[0], ", b =", arr[1]);

swap(arr, 0, 1);

console.log("After swapping: a =", arr[0], ", b =", arr[1]);
```

Note that these solutions are just examples and may not be the most efficient or robust implementations.
