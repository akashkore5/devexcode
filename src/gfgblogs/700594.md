### Summary
Given a linked list and an integer `n`, find the sum of the last `n` nodes in the linked list. This problem is related to data structures and manipulation of linked lists.


### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we will traverse the linked list from the end to the beginning. We keep track of the sum of the last `n` nodes as we iterate through the linked list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Traverse the linked list from the end to the beginning using a pointer `p`.
3. As you traverse, keep track of the sum of the last `n` nodes by adding each node's value to `sum`.
4. Return `sum`.

The time complexity for this solution is O(L), where L is the length of the linked list, since we need to traverse the entire list. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the traversal:
```
    5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
      ^
      p (starts at the end)
```


### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int findSum(int n, Node head) {
        int sum = 0;
        Node p = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += p.data;
            p = p.next;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def find_sum(self, n, head):
        sum = 0
        p = head
        for _ in range(n):
            sum += p.data
            p = p.next
        return sum
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findSum(int n, Node* head) {
        int sum = 0;
        Node* p = head;
        while (n--) {
            sum += p->data;
            p = p->next;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
class Solution {
    findSum(n, head) {
        let sum = 0;
        let p = head;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += p.data;
            p = p.next;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Note: In the above solutions, `Node` is a class representing a node in the linked list.
