# Int Str -- 164410

## Summary

This problem deals with converting integers to strings in Python. The goal is to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns its string representation. This involves understanding how Python handles integer conversion, as well as applying basic programming concepts.

## Detailed Explanation

The provided problem statement doesn't contain the specific details about what "Int Str" means or what kind of integer it refers to (e.g., hexadecimal, binary, decimal). However, for the sake of this explanation, let's assume that we're asked to write a function in Python that takes an integer as input and returns its string representation.

To solve this problem, we can utilize Python's built-in `str()` function. This function automatically converts any data type into a string. Here's how you can implement it:

1.  Define a function called `int_to_str` with one parameter, `n`, which represents the integer to be converted.
2.  Use the `str()` function to convert the input integer `n` into its string representation and return the result.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
```
def int_to_str(n):
    # Convert the integer n to its string representation
    str_n = str(n)
    
    # Return the string representation
    return str_n
```

Time complexity: O(1) because the conversion process doesn't depend on the size of the input.

Space complexity: O(log n) due to the space required for storing the result (string).

## Optimized Solutions

### Python

```python
def int_to_str(n):
    # Convert the integer n to its string representation
    str_n = str(n)
    
    # Return the string representation
    return str_n
```

### Java

```java
public class Main {
    public static String intToStr(int n) {
        // Convert the integer n to its string representation
        String strN = Integer.toString(n);
        
        // Return the string representation
        return strN;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::string intToStr(int n) {
    // Convert the integer n to its string representation
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << n;

    // Return the string representation
    return ss.str();
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
function intToStr(n) {
    // Convert the integer n to its string representation
    let strN = String(n);
    
    // Return the string representation
    return strN;
}
```
Note that these optimized solutions are not necessarily more efficient than the original Python solution, but they demonstrate how to implement the same functionality in different programming languages.
