# The Light Problem
## Summary
The Light Problem involves finding the minimum number of lights needed to light up all points in a given grid. The problem requires a combination of logic and algorithmic thinking, making it an interesting challenge for beginners.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we will iterate through each point in the grid and count the number of lights that can be seen from that point. We then update our total count based on this count. This process is repeated until all points have been processed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `lights` to 0, which will store the minimum number of lights needed.
2. Iterate through each row in the grid from top to bottom and for each column from left to right.
3. For each point in the grid, initialize a variable `visibleLights` to 0, which will count the number of lights that can be seen from this point.
4. Check if there are any lights to the left or above the current point. If yes, increment `visibleLights`.
5. Check if there are any lights to the right or below the current point. If yes, increment `visibleLights`.
6. Update the total count of lights (`lights`) by adding 1 and the count of visible lights.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until all points in the grid have been processed.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class LightProblem {
    public static int minLights(int[][] grid) {
        int lights = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                int visibleLights = 0;
                if (i > 0 || j > 0) {
                    visibleLights++;
                }
                if (i < grid.length - 1 || j < grid[0].length - 1) {
                    visibleLights++;
                }
                lights += 1 + visibleLights;
            }
        }
        return lights;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_lights(grid):
    lights = 0
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            visible_lights = 0
            if i > 0 or j > 0:
                visible_lights += 1
            if i < len(grid) - 1 or j < len(grid[0]) - 1:
                visible_lights += 1
            lights += 1 + visible_lights
    return lights
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int minLights(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int lights = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
            int visibleLights = 0;
            if (i > 0 || j > 0) {
                visibleLights++;
            }
            if (i < grid.size() - 1 || j < grid[0].size() - 1) {
                visibleLights++;
            }
            lights += 1 + visibleLights;
        }
    }
    return lights;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minLights(grid) {
    let lights = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            let visibleLights = 0;
            if (i > 0 || j > 0) {
                visibleLights++;
            }
            if (i < grid.length - 1 || j < grid[0].length - 1) {
                visibleLights++;
            }
            lights += 1 + visibleLights;
        }
    }
    return lights;
}
