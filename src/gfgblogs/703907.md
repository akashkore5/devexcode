# Maximum Weight Difference

## Summary

The problem involves finding the maximum absolute difference between weights in an array. The key concepts involved are arrays and data structures, specifically searching and sorting algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the array once. We keep track of the minimum and maximum weight encountered so far. For each element in the array, we update these values as needed to ensure that `maxWeight - minWeight` always represents the maximum absolute difference between weights.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize two variables: `minWeight` to store the smallest weight and `maxWeight` to store the largest weight.
2. Iterate through the array:
	* For each element, update `minWeight` if the current element is smaller than the previous minimum.
	* Update `maxWeight` if the current element is larger than the previous maximum.
3. Return `maxWeight - minWeight` as the result.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We only need to iterate through the array once, so the time complexity is linear.

Space complexity: O(1). We only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum and maximum weights, regardless of the size of the input array.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int maxWeightDifference(int[] weights) {
    int minWeight = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int maxWeight = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    for (int weight : weights) {
        if (weight < minWeight) {
            minWeight = weight;
        } else if (weight > maxWeight) {
            maxWeight = weight;
        }
    }

    return Math.abs(maxWeight - minWeight);
}
```

### Python
```python
def max_weight_difference(weights):
    min_weight = float('inf')
    max_weight = float('-inf')

    for weight in weights:
        if weight < min_weight:
            min_weight = weight
        elif weight > max_weight:
            max_weight = weight

    return abs(max_weight - min_weight)
```

### C++
```cpp
int maxWeightDifference(int* weights, int n) {
    int minWeight = INT_MAX;
    int maxWeight = INT_MIN;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (weights[i] < minWeight) {
            minWeight = weights[i];
        } else if (weights[i] > maxWeight) {
            maxWeight = weights[i];
        }
    }

    return abs(maxWeight - minWeight);
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxWeightDifference(weights) {
    let minWeight = Infinity;
    let maxWeight = -Infinity;

    for (let weight of weights) {
        if (weight < minWeight) {
            minWeight = weight;
        } else if (weight > maxWeight) {
            maxWeight = weight;
        }
    }

    return Math.abs(maxWeight - minWeight);
}
```

Note that all solutions have the same time and space complexity, O(n) and O(1), respectively.
