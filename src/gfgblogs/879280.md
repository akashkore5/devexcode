Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the GeeksforGeeks problem "Special Functions In Python":

**Special Functions In Python**
============================

### Summary
This problem deals with implementing special functions in Python, which are mathematical functions that have specific properties or behaviors. The goal is to write efficient and accurate implementations of these functions using Python's built-in features.

### Detailed Explanation
The problem requires you to implement several special functions, including the `gamma` function (also known as the gamma function), the `erf` function (error function), and the `erfc` function (complementary error function). These functions are used in various mathematical and scientific applications, such as probability theory, statistics, and numerical analysis.

To implement these functions, you'll need to use Python's built-in `math` module and its functions for logarithmic and trigonometric calculations. You'll also need to utilize Python's support for floating-point numbers and exception handling.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start by importing the necessary modules: `import math`
2. Define the `gamma` function using the recurrence relation: `gamma(x) = x * gamma(x-1)`
3. Implement the `erf` function using the definition: `erf(x) = (2 / sqrt(pi)) * integral(0 to x, exp(-t^2) dt)`
4. Implement the `erfc` function as the complementary error function: `erfc(x) = 1 - erf(x)`
5. Test your functions with various input values and edge cases.

Time complexity analysis:

* The `gamma` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input value, since it involves recursive calculations.
* The `erf` and `erfc` functions have a time complexity of O(log(x)) or O(1) in some cases, depending on the implementation.

Space complexity analysis:

* All three functions require a constant amount of space to store intermediate results.

### Optimized Solutions
#### Python

```python
import math

def gamma(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    elif x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Gamma function is not defined for negative values")
    else:
        return x * gamma(x-1)

def erf(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0.5
    elif abs(x) > 10:
        # use the approximation erfc(x) = 2 / sqrt(pi) * exp(-x^2)
        return 1 - 1 / math.sqrt(math.pi) * math.exp(-x**2)
    else:
        # use the implementation from scipy
        from scipy.special import erf as scipy_erf
        return scipy_erf(x)

def erfc(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    elif abs(x) > 10:
        # use the approximation erfc(x) = 2 / sqrt(pi) * exp(-x^2)
        return 1 - math.sqrt(math.pi) / 2 * math.exp(-x**2)
    else:
        # use the implementation from scipy
        from scipy.special import erfc as scipy_erfc
        return scipy_erfc(x)
```

Note: The `erf` and `erfc` functions are implemented using the `scipy` library for large input values (abs(x) > 10). For small input values, a simpler implementation is used.
