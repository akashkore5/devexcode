**Minimum Move to Front Operations**
=====================================

## Summary
The problem "Minimum move to front operations" involves manipulating an array such that all elements are in ascending order, minimizing the number of moves. This is a basic algorithmic problem that requires moving elements from their current positions to the front of the array while maintaining the original order.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the sorted array.
2. Iterate through the input array from left to right.
3. For each element, check if it is in its correct position (i.e., at the front of the array). If not, move it to the front by appending it to the `result` list and removing it from the original array.
4. Repeat step 3 until all elements are in their correct positions.

Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the process:
```
Original array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
Result array: [] (empty)

 Move 1: [5] -> [5, 3]
Move 2: [3] -> [3, 5, 8]
Move 3: [8] -> [8, 3, 5, 4]
Move 4: [4] -> [4, 8, 3, 5, 2]
Move 5: [2] -> [2, 4, 8, 3, 5]

Final result: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```
## Optimized Solutions
Here are the optimized solutions in various programming languages:

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2};
        int[] result = new int[arr.length];
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                result[++j] = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def min_move_to_front(arr):
    result = []
    j = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            result.append(arr[i])
            j += 1
    return result

arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
print(min_move_to_front(arr))
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> minMoveToFront(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    int j = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
            result.push_back(arr[i]);
            j++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2};
    std::cout << minMoveToFront(arr).size() << std::endl;
    for (int i : minMoveToFront(arr)) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function minMoveToFront(arr) {
    let result = [];
    let j = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
            result.push(arr[i]);
            j++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

let arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2];
console.log(minMoveToFront(arr));
```
