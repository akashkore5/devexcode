**Total Number Of Spanning Trees In A Graph**
====================================================================

## Summary
Given a connected undirected graph, we need to find out the total number of spanning trees in it. The problem seems to be related to graph theory and tree traversal.

## Detailed Explanation
A spanning tree is a subgraph that connects all vertices in a graph with no cycles. Finding the total number of spanning trees is a classic problem in computer science, which can be solved using Kirchhoff's theorem or Matrix Tree Theorem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  First, we need to find out the number of nodes (vertices) and edges in the graph.
2.  Then, we need to calculate the determinant of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. This can be done by constructing an adjacency matrix for the graph and then calculating the Laplacian matrix from it.
3.  Once we have the Laplacian matrix, we can find out its determinant using any standard linear algebra library or algorithm.
4.  The determinant value will give us the total number of spanning trees in the graph.

Here's a simple example to illustrate this:

    ```
    Graph: A---B---C
           |     |
           D     E
    ```

    In this graph, we can see that there are four nodes (A, B, C and D) and five edges. The Laplacian matrix of the graph will be:
    
    ```
    [[-1  1  0   1  0]
     [ 1 -2  1   0  1]
     [ 0  1 -1   1  0]
     [ 1  0  1  -3  1]
     [ 0  1  0   1 -1]]
    ```

    The determinant of this Laplacian matrix will give us the total number of spanning trees in this graph.

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes (vertices) in the graph. This is because we need to calculate the Laplacian matrix and then find its determinant, both of which involve iterating over all nodes in the graph.

Space Complexity: O(n^2), as we need to store the adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix for the graph.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Assuming you have a function to construct the Laplacian matrix
        int[][] laplacianMatrix = getLaplacianMatrix(graph);
        int determinant = calculateDeterminant(laplacianMatrix);
        System.out.println("Total number of spanning trees: " + determinant);
    }

    public static int[][] getLaplacianMatrix(Graph graph) {
        // Your implementation to construct the Laplacian matrix
    }

    public static int calculateDeterminant(int[][] matrix) {
        // Your implementation to calculate the determinant of the Laplacian matrix
    }
}

```

### Python
```python
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Assuming you have a function to construct the Laplacian matrix
    laplacian_matrix = get_laplacian_matrix(graph)
    determinant = np.linalg.det(laplacian_matrix)
    print("Total number of spanning trees: ", determinant)

def get_laplacian_matrix(graph):
    # Your implementation to construct the Laplacian matrix

def calculate_determinant(matrix):
    # Your implementation to calculate the determinant of the Laplacian matrix

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void main() {
    // Assuming you have a function to construct the Laplacian matrix
    vector<vector<int>> laplacianMatrix = getLaplacianMatrix(graph);
    int determinant = calculateDeterminant(laplacianMatrix);
    cout << "Total number of spanning trees: " << determinant << endl;
}

vector<vector<int>> getLaplacianMatrix(Graph graph) {
    // Your implementation to construct the Laplacian matrix
}

int calculateDeterminant(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    // Your implementation to calculate the determinant of the Laplacian matrix
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function main() {
    // Assuming you have a function to construct the Laplacian matrix
    let laplacianMatrix = getLaplacianMatrix(graph);
    let determinant = calculateDeterminant(laplacianMatrix);
    console.log("Total number of spanning trees: " + determinant);
}

function getLaplacianMatrix(graph) {
    // Your implementation to construct the Laplacian matrix
}

function calculateDeterminant(matrix) {
    // Your implementation to calculate the determinant of the Laplacian matrix
}
```

Note that these solutions are just examples and may not work for all cases. You will need to implement your own functions to construct the Laplacian matrix and calculate its determinant based on your specific problem requirements.
