**Number of times graph cuts X-axis**
=============================

## Summary
Given a set of points (x, y) in a 2D plane, find out how many times the graph formed by these points cuts the x-axis. The graph is considered to cut the x-axis when a point's y-coordinate changes sign from negative to positive.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved using a simple algorithm that iterates through the set of points and checks if the current point's y-coordinate has changed sign compared to the previous one. If it has, increment a counter to keep track of how many times the graph cuts the x-axis.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `cuts` to 0, which will store the number of times the graph cuts the x-axis.
2. Iterate through the set of points (x, y).
3. For each point, check if the current point's y-coordinate has changed sign compared to the previous one. This can be done by checking if `y * prev_y` is negative or positive.
4. If the sign has changed, increment the `cuts` variable.
5. Update the `prev_y` variable with the current point's y-coordinate.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of points in the set.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `cuts` and `prev_y` variables.

Here is an ASCII art diagram illustrating the problem:

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int countCuts(int[][] points) {
    int cuts = 0;
    double prev_y = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
    for (int[] point : points) {
        if ((point[1] * prev_y) < 0) {
            cuts++;
        }
        prev_y = point[1];
    }
    return cuts;
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_cuts(points):
    cuts = 0
    prev_y = float('-inf')
    for point in points:
        if (point[1] * prev_y) < 0:
            cuts += 1
        prev_y = point[1]
    return cuts
```

### C++
```cpp
int countCuts(int** points, int n) {
    int cuts = 0;
    double prev_y = -INFINITY;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if ((points[i][1] * prev_y) < 0) {
            cuts++;
        }
        prev_y = points[i][1];
    }
    return cuts;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countCuts(points) {
    let cuts = 0;
    let prev_y = -Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        if ((points[i][1] * prev_y) < 0) {
            cuts++;
        }
        prev_y = points[i][1];
    }
    return cuts;
}
```
