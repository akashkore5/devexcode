### Summary
The problem involves sorting a list of employees based on their names. The twist is that the names are given in the format "First Name Last Name" and we need to sort them alphabetically while considering both first and last names.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the built-in sorting function available in most programming languages. However, since the problem statement mentions arrays and strings as topic tags, let's implement a custom sorting algorithm to learn more about how it works under the hood.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Split each employee name into two parts: first name and last name.
2. Combine these two parts with a space in between to form the full name.
3. Use the built-in sort function or implement a custom sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) to sort the list of full names alphabetically.

For this problem, we can use a simple bubble sort algorithm since it's an easy problem and the arrays are relatively small.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class EmployeeSort {
    public static String[] sortEmployees(String[] employees) {
        Arrays.sort(employees, new Comparator<String>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
                return s1.compareTo(s2);
            }
        });
        return employees;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def sort_employees(employees):
    employees.sort(key=lambda x: x)
    return employees
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

std::vector<std::string> sortEmployees(std::vector<std::string> employees) {
    std::sort(employees.begin(), employees.end());
    return employees;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function sortEmployees(employees) {
    return employees.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
}
```

Note that the optimized solutions use built-in sorting functions or methods to achieve the same result as the custom bubble sort algorithm.
