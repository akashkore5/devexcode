**Maximum Triple Product**
=====================

### Summary
Given an array of integers, find the maximum product that can be obtained by selecting three numbers from the array. The product should be calculated as `a * b * c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the selected numbers.

This problem requires a combination of logical thinking and mathematical manipulation to arrive at the optimal solution.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start by sorting the array in descending order. This is because the maximum product will be obtained when we select the three largest numbers from the array. Then, we can calculate the product of these three numbers and return it as the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Select the first three elements of the sorted array (which are the largest numbers).
3. Calculate the product of these three numbers.
4. Return the calculated product as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only need a constant amount of space to store the temporary variables.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static int maximumTripleProduct(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        return arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[2];
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def maximum_triple_product(arr):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    return arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[2]
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
int maximumTripleProduct(int* arr, int n) {
    std::sort(arr, arr+n);
    return arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[2];
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function maximumTripleProduct(arr) {
    arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    return arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[2];
}
```
