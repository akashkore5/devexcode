Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the problem "Smallest number repeating K times":

# Smallest number repeating K times

## Summary
The problem involves finding the smallest number that, when repeated k times, will result in a specific sum. This problem can be approached using basic algorithmic concepts such as arrays and hash data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to generate all numbers from 1 to n (where n is the given input) and find the smallest number that, when repeated k times, will result in a specific sum. We can use an array to store these generated numbers and their corresponding counts. Then, we iterate over the array to find the smallest number that meets our condition.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty hash map `countMap` to store the count of each number from 1 to n.
2. Iterate through the range from 1 to n and for each number, increment its count in the `countMap`.
3. Initialize a variable `smallestNumber` to store the smallest number that meets our condition.
4. Iterate over the `countMap` to find the smallest number that, when repeated k times, will result in the specific sum.
5. For each number and its count, check if multiplying the number by k and adding it to the current total equals the specific sum. If yes, update `smallestNumber`.
6. Return `smallestNumber`.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```
java
public class SmallestNumberRepeatingKTimes {
    public static int findSmallest(int n, int k, int sum) {
        int smallest = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            while ((i * k) + count <= sum) {
                count += i * k;
            }
            if (count == sum) {
                smallest = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return smallest;
    }
}
```

### Python
```
python
def find_smallest(n, k, sum):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        count = 0
        while (i * k) + count <= sum:
            count += i * k
        if count == sum:
            return i
    return 0
```

### C++
```
cpp
#include <iostream>
int findSmallest(int n, int k, int sum) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int count = 0;
        while ((i * k) + count <= sum) {
            count += i * k;
        }
        if (count == sum) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```
javascript
function findSmallest(n, k, sum) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let count = 0;
        while ((i * k) + count <= sum) {
            count += i * k;
        }
        if (count == sum) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
