**Min Cost to Make Size 1**
======================

### Summary
Given a list of integers, find the minimum cost to make all sizes equal to 1. The cost is calculated by summing up the absolute difference between each element and 1.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will iterate over the list and calculate the total cost. For each element, we subtract or add 1 depending on whether it's greater than or less than 1 to make its size equal to 1. The total cost is then calculated as the sum of absolute differences.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize a variable `cost` to keep track of the total cost.
2. Iterate over the list and for each element, calculate the difference between the element and 1 (abs(element - 1)).
3. Add this difference to the `cost`.
4. Return the `cost`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input list.

Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `cost` variable.

### Optimized Solutions
#### Java
```java
public int minCostToMakeSize1(int[] arr) {
    int cost = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        cost += Math.abs(num - 1);
    }
    return cost;
}
```
#### Python
```python
def min_cost_to_make_size_1(arr):
    cost = 0
    for num in arr:
        cost += abs(num - 1)
    return cost
```
#### C++
```cpp
int minCostToMakeSize1(int* arr, int n) {
    int cost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cost += abs(arr[i] - 1);
    }
    return cost;
}
```
#### JavaScript
```javascript
function minCostToMakeSize1(arr) {
    let cost = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        cost += Math.abs(num - 1);
    }
    return cost;
}
```
