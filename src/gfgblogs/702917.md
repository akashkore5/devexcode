## Summary
Given an array of integers, the task is to find the number of increasing subarrays in the given array. An increasing subarray is a sequence of consecutive elements that are strictly increasing.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, there are five increasing subarrays: `[1, 2]`, `[2, 3]`, `[3, 4]`, `[4, 5]`, and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. If the input array is `[1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`, there are four increasing subarrays: `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1, 3]`, `[3, 4]`, and `[4, 5]`.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a counter for the number of increasing subarrays found so far.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the number of increasing subarrays.
2. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the beginning of the array.
3. Iterate through the array with the `end` pointer:
    * For each element at index `i` (represented by `arr[i]`), check if it is greater than the previous element (`arr[i-1]`). If it is, increment the `count` variable and move both pointers to the next element.
    * If the current element is not greater than the previous one, reset the `start` pointer to the current index and continue iterating with the `end` pointer.
4. The final value of `count` represents the number of increasing subarrays in the given array.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and count variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int countIncreasingSubarrays(int[] arr) {
    int count = 0;
    int start = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i-1]) {
            count++;
            start = i;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_increasing_subarrays(arr):
    count = 0
    start = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:
            count += 1
            start = i
    return count
```

### C++
```cpp
int countIncreasingSubarrays(int* arr, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int start = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i-1]) {
            count++;
            start = i;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countIncreasingSubarrays(arr) {
    let count = 0;
    let start = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i-1]) {
            count++;
            start = i;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
