Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the problem "Pairwise swap elements of a linked list":

**700024. Pairwise Swap Elements of a Linked List by Swapping Data**
=====================

## Summary
Given a singly linked list, pairwise swap its elements without using any extra space or recursion. This problem requires understanding and manipulation of linked lists.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we'll iterate through the linked list, swapping each pair of nodes. We can do this by keeping track of two pointers: `prev` and `curr`. `prev` will point to the previous node, while `curr` will point to the current node. We'll move `prev` one step ahead after processing each pair.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `prev` as `NULL` and `curr` as the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list until `curr` is `NULL`.
3. For each iteration:
   - Store the value of `curr->next` in a temporary variable, say `tempNext`.
   - Set `curr->next` to `prev`'s value (i.e., swap the next pointer).
   - Move `prev` one step ahead by setting it to `curr`. Update `curr` to `tempNext`.
4. Return the modified linked list.

Here's a diagram illustrating this process:
```
     1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
       ^         ^
       |         |
       prev      curr
    Swap: 1<->2, 3<->4
     2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
```
Time complexity analysis:

* The algorithm processes each node in the linked list once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes.

Space complexity analysis:

* We only use a constant amount of space to store the temporary variable and the two pointers, so the space complexity remains O(1).

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public ListNode pairwiseSwap(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

    ListNode prev = null;
    ListNode curr = head;

    while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
        ListNode tempNext = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = tempNext;
    }

    return prev;
}
```

### Python
```python
def pairwise_swap(head):
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head

    prev, curr = None, head

    while curr and curr.next:
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node

    return prev
```

### C++
```cpp
ListNode* pairwiseSwap(ListNode* head) {
    if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) return head;

    ListNode* prev = nullptr;
    ListNode* curr = head;

    while (curr != nullptr && curr->next != nullptr) {
        ListNode* tempNext = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = tempNext;
    }

    return prev;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function pairwiseSwap(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;

    let prev = null;
    let curr = head;

    while (curr && curr.next) {
        const nextNode = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = nextNode;
    }

    return prev;
}
```
