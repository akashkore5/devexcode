## Summary
The problem involves calculating the sum of an array. Given a numerical array, write a program to calculate its total sum. This problem is based on basic data structures and algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through each element in the array and adds them up. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start with an initialized variable `sum` set to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `arr[i]` in the array.
3. For each iteration, add the current element `arr[i]` to the `sum`.
4. After the loop finishes, return the final value of `sum`.

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, since we need to iterate through each element once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a single variable to store the sum.

Here's a pseudocode representation of the solution:

```markdown
function sumArray(arr):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        sum += arr[i]
    return sum
```

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int sumArray(int[] arr) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i : arr) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Python
```python
def sum_array(arr):
    return sum(arr)
```

### C++
```cpp
int sumArray(int* arr, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumArray(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i of arr) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```
