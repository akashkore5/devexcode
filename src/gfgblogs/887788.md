**Subtract 1 without using Arithmetic Operators**
=====================================================

## Summary
Given an integer, write a function that subtracts 1 from it without using arithmetic operators (i.e., no subtraction, addition, multiplication, or division). This problem requires creative use of bitwise operations to achieve the desired result. The key concepts involved are bitwise operators and their properties.

## Detailed Explanation
------------------------

The approach is to use bitwise XOR (^) operation to subtract 1 from a given number. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Convert the integer to binary form.
2. For each bit position, perform a bitwise XOR operation with the original value and the value obtained by flipping all bits (i.e., inverting the bits).
3. The result of the XOR operation is the original value minus 1.

Here's an example:
```markdown
    Input: 5 (binary: 101)
    Flip all bits: ~5 = -6 (binary: 01111111111111111111111111111010)
    XOR with flipped bits: 5 ^ (-6) = 4 (binary: 100)
```
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it only involves a fixed number of bitwise operations. The space complexity is also O(1), since it doesn't require any additional storage.

## Optimized Solutions
-------------------------

### Java
```java
public int subtractOne(int n) {
    return n ^ (n >> 31);
}
```
### Python
```python
def subtract_one(n):
    return n ^ (~n & ((1 << 32) - 1))
```
### C++
```cpp
int subtractOne(int n) {
    return n ^ (~n & ((1 << 31) - 1));
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function subtractOne(n) {
    return n ^ (~n & ((1 << 31) - 1));
}
```
Note that these optimized solutions use bitwise operations to achieve the desired result.
