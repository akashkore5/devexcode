# Reducing Walls

## Summary

The "Reducing Walls" problem involves reducing a given array of walls to minimize their overall length. The goal is to find the optimal way to merge adjacent walls while maintaining their integrity, ensuring that no two adjacent walls are merged. This problem requires an understanding of arrays and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array of walls and maintain a variable `current_wall` to keep track of the current wall being processed. For each wall in the array:

1. If the current wall is not merged with the previous one (i.e., their lengths are different), increment the `merged_walls` counter.
2. Update the `current_wall` length by adding the length of the current wall to the previous wall's length (if it existed).
3. Repeat this process until all walls have been processed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

```
 1. Initialize `merged_walls` = 0 and `current_wall` = null
 2. Iterate through the array of walls:
    - If `current_wall` is null or its length differs from the current wall's length:
      - Increment `merged_walls` by 1
      - Update `current_wall` to be the sum of the current wall's length and the previous wall's length (if it existed)
    - Repeat until all walls have been processed
```

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of walls in the array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store `merged_walls` and `current_wall`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int reduceWalls(int[] walls) {
    int mergedWalls = 0;
    int currentWall = 0;

    for (int wall : walls) {
        if (wall != currentWall) {
            mergedWalls++;
            currentWall = wall;
        }
    }

    return mergedWalls;
}
```

### Python
```python
def reduce_walls(walls):
    merged_walls = 0
    current_wall = 0

    for wall in walls:
        if wall != current_wall:
            merged_walls += 1
            current_wall = wall

    return merged_walls
```

### C++
```cpp
int reduceWalls(int* walls, int n) {
    int mergedWalls = 0;
    int currentWall = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (walls[i] != currentWall) {
            mergedWalls++;
            currentWall = walls[i];
        }
    }

    return mergedWalls;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function reduceWalls(walls) {
    let mergedWalls = 0;
    let currentWall = 0;

    for (let wall of walls) {
        if (wall !== currentWall) {
            mergedWalls++;
            currentWall = wall;
        }
    }

    return mergedWalls;
}
```

These optimized solutions maintain the same time and space complexity as the original solution.
