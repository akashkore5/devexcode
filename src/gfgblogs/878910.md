**Divisor**
================

## Summary
The problem is about finding all divisors of a given integer. This involves identifying the numbers that can be divided by the original number without leaving a remainder.

## Detailed Explanation
The algorithmic approach to this problem is simple: iterate from 1 to the input number and check if the current number is a divisor. A divisor is defined as an integer that divides the original number without leaving a remainder. We can use the modulo operator (`%`) to perform this check efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty list or array to store the divisors.
2. Iterate from 1 to the input number `n`.
3. For each iteration, check if the current number `i` is a divisor by checking if `n % i == 0`. If it is, add `i` to the list of divisors.
4. Return the list of divisors.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the input number. This is because we iterate from 1 to n and perform a constant-time operation (checking for divisibility) at each iteration.

Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the list of divisors.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public List<Integer> findDivisors(int n) {
    List<Integer> divisors = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            divisors.add(i);
        }
    }
    return divisors;
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return divisors
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> findDivisors(int n) {
    std::vector<int> divisors;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            divisors.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return divisors;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findDivisors(n) {
    let divisors = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            divisors.push(i);
        }
    }
    return divisors;
}
```
