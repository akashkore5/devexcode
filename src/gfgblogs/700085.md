### Summary
Given a singly linked list and an integer `n`, print the elements of the linked list in zig-zag order. The order is alternating between left to right and right to left. This problem requires manipulating the linked list nodes and adjusting the pointers accordingly.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we'll use a simple algorithm that iterates through the linked list and prints the elements based on the zig-zag pattern. We'll keep track of whether we're currently printing from left to right or right to left using a boolean flag `direction`. When `direction` is `true`, we print from left to right, and when it's `false`, we print from right to left.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty stack `S`.
2. Traverse the linked list.
3. For each node:
   * If `direction` is `true`, push the current node onto `S` and set `direction` to `false`. This indicates we're switching from left to right to right to left.
   * Otherwise (i.e., `direction` is `false`), pop a node from `S` and print its value. Set `direction` to `true`.
4. Continue this process until the linked list is fully traversed.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the use of a stack to store nodes.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public void printZigZag(Node head, int n) {
    boolean direction = true;
    Stack<Node> S = new Stack<>();
    Node curr = head;

    while (curr != null) {
        if (direction) {
            S.push(curr);
            direction = false;
        } else {
            System.out.println(curr.data);
            direction = true;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
    }

    while (!S.isEmpty()) {
        System.out.println(S.pop().data);
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def print_zigzag(head, n):
    direction = True
    S = []
    curr = head

    while curr:
        if direction:
            S.append(curr)
            direction = False
        else:
            print(curr.data)
            direction = True
            curr = curr.next
    while S:
        print(S.pop().data)
```

#### C++
```cpp
void printZigZag(Node* head, int n) {
    bool direction = true;
    stack<Node*> S;
    Node* curr = head;

    while (curr != nullptr) {
        if (direction) {
            S.push(curr);
            direction = false;
        } else {
            cout << curr->data << endl;
            direction = true;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }

    while (!S.empty()) {
        cout << S.top()->data << endl;
        S.pop();
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function printZigZag(head, n) {
  let direction = true;
  const S = [];
  let curr = head;

  while (curr) {
    if (direction) {
      S.push(curr);
      direction = false;
    } else {
      console.log(curr.data);
      direction = true;
      curr = curr.next;
    }
  }

  while (!S.length) {
    console.log(S.pop().data);
  }
}
```
