Here is the Markdown blog post for the GeeksforGeeks problem "Pattern 6":

**711658: Pattern 6**

## Summary
This problem involves generating a triangular pattern based on a given input. The key concept involved is array manipulation, specifically building and printing triangles.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem requires us to generate a triangular pattern of asterisks (*) where the number of rows (n) is provided as input. Each row should have one more asterisk than the previous row. For example, if n = 5, the output would be:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```
To solve this problem, we can use a simple loop that iterates over each row of the triangle and prints the corresponding number of asterisks.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an integer variable `i` to keep track of the current row.
2. Start a loop that runs from 1 to n (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, print `i` asterisks followed by a newline character (`\n`) to start a new line.
4. Increment `i` for each iteration of the loop.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the input number of rows.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the current row index and other variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Pattern6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // input number of rows
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def pattern6(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        print(*["*" for _ in range(i)], sep="")
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n = 5; // input number of rows
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            std::cout << "*";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function pattern6(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let row = "";
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            row += "*";
        }
        console.log(row);
    }
}
```

Note: In the Python and JavaScript solutions, we use a list comprehension or array literal to generate the asterisks for each row, which is more concise than using a nested loop.
