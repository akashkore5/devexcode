**Number of Triangles**
=====================

## Summary
Given a set of points in a two-dimensional space, find the number of triangles that can be formed using three points each. This problem requires an understanding of combinatorics and basic geometry.

## Detailed Explanation
The key idea is to calculate the number of ways we can choose 3 points from the given set of n points. We can do this by choosing one point at a time, resulting in `n` options for the first point, `n-1` options for the second point, and `n-2` options for the third point. This gives us a total of `n*(n-1)*(n-2)` possible triangles.

However, we need to subtract 3 from this value because the three points chosen cannot form a triangle if they are collinear (i.e., lie on the same line). To account for this, we can calculate the number of ways to choose 3 collinear points using permutations and combinations. This gives us `n*(n-1)/2` possible triangles.

The final step is to subtract this value from our initial calculation: `n*(n-1)*(n-2) - n*(n-1)/2`. This leaves us with the number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed using three points each, which is `(n-2)*n*(n-1)/2`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `num_triangles` to 0.
2. Calculate `n*(n-1)*(n-2)` as the total number of ways we can choose 3 points from the given set.
3. Subtract `n*(n-1)/2` to account for collinear triangles.
4. The result is the number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)
