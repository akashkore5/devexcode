Here is the detailed Markdown blog post for the "First Repeating Element" problem:

# First Repeating Element

## Summary

Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element. This problem involves arrays and hash data structures, making it a great exercise in understanding how to efficiently solve problems using these fundamental concepts.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a HashSet to store unique elements from the array and then iterate through the array again to check for duplicates. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Create an empty HashSet.
2. Iterate through the array and add each element to the HashSet if it's not already present (this will automatically remove duplicates).
3. Initialize a variable `firstRepeat` to null.
4. Iterate through the array again, this time checking each element against the HashSet.
5. If an element is found in the HashSet, update `firstRepeat` with that element and break out of the loop.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, since we're doing a single pass through the array to create the HashSet and another pass to find the first repeating element. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst-case scenario (all elements are unique), we'll store all elements in the HashSet.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the algorithm:

       |    Array     |

       |  to null          |

       |  array again     |
       |  to find first    |
       |  repeating element|

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class FirstRepeatingElement {
    public static int findFirstRepeating(int[] arr) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (!set.add(num)) {
                return num;
            }
        }
        return -1; // no repeating elements found
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_first_repeating(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
        else:
            return num
    return None  # no repeating elements found
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

int findFirstRepeating(int* arr, int size) {
    std::unordered_set<int> set;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (!set.insert(arr[i]).second) {
            return arr[i];
        }
    }
    return -1; // no repeating elements found
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findFirstRepeating(arr) {
    const seen = new Set();
    for (const num of arr) {
        if (!seen.has(num)) {
            seen.add(num);
        } else {
            return num;
        }
    }
    return null; // no repeating elements found
}
```

Note that the optimized solutions provided are in different programming languages, but they all follow the same basic approach: using a HashSet to keep track of unique elements and then iterating through the array again to find the first repeating element.
