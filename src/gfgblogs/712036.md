**Pattern 18**
=====================================================

## Summary
The Pattern 18 problem involves generating a specific triangular pattern. The pattern is formed by printing numbers in a triangular shape, where each row has one more number than the previous row. This problem requires applying algorithmic concepts to efficiently generate and print the desired pattern.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we'll use a simple iterative approach. We'll start by initializing an empty string `result` that will store the generated pattern. Then, we'll iterate from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the number of rows in the triangle.

In each iteration, we'll add a new row to the result string. The length of each row will increase by 1 for each subsequent iteration. We'll fill the row with numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent number. Finally, we'll add a newline character at the end of each row.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty string `result`.
2. Iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each iteration:
    * Calculate the length of the current row (`row_length`) by adding 1 to the previous row's length.
    * Fill the row with numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent number.
    * Add a newline character at the end of the row.
    * Append the row to the `result` string.
4. Return the generated pattern (`result`).

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1) (since we're only storing the generated pattern)

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public static String generateTriangle(int n) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int rowLength = i;
        for (int j = 1; j <= rowLength; j++) {
            result.append(j).append(" ");
        }
        result.append("\n");
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```
### Python
```python
def generate_triangle(n):
    result = ""
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        row_length = i
        for j in range(1, row_length+1):
            result += str(j) + " "
        result += "\n"
    return result
```
### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string generateTriangle(int n) {
    std::string result = "";
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int rowLength = i;
        for (int j = 1; j <= rowLength; j++) {
            result += std::to_string(j) + " ";
        }
        result += "\n";
    }
    return result;
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function generateTriangle(n) {
    let result = "";
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let rowLength = i;
        for (let j = 1; j <= rowLength; j++) {
            result += j + " ";
        }
        result += "\n";
    }
    return result;
}
```
