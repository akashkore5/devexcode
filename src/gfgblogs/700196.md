## Summary
This problem involves removing duplicate elements from a sorted linked list. The key concept involved is the manipulation of a linked list, specifically to remove duplicates while maintaining the original order.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the linked list and compare each node's value with the previous one. If they are equal, we skip that node (remove the duplicate). If not, we move on to the next node. This approach ensures that we only keep unique elements in the linked list.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `curr` and `prev`, to the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list until `curr` reaches the end.
3. For each node, compare its value with the previous node's value (`prev->data`).
4. If they are equal, skip this node (move `curr` one step forward) and continue to the next iteration.
5. If they are not equal, update `prev` to the current node and move `curr` one step forward.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until `curr` reaches the end of the linked list.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space (for the two pointers).

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class RemoveDuplicates {
    public static Node removeDuplicates(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;

        Node curr = head;
        Node prev = head;

        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            if (curr.data == prev.data) {
                curr = curr.next;
                continue;
            }
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

def remove_duplicates(head):
    if head is None:
        return head

    curr = head
    prev = head

    while curr and curr.next:
        if curr.data == prev.data:
            curr = curr.next
            continue
        prev = curr
        curr = curr.next

    return head
```

### C++
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int x) : data(x), next(NULL) {}
};

Node* removeDuplicates(Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL) return NULL;

    Node* curr = head;
    Node* prev = head;

    while (curr && curr->next) {
        if (curr->data == prev->data) {
            curr = curr->next;
            continue;
        }
        prev = curr;
        curr = curr->next;
    }

    return head;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function removeDuplicates(head) {
  if (head === null) return head;

  let curr = head;
  let prev = head;

  while (curr && curr.next) {
    if (curr.data === prev.data) {
      curr = curr.next;
      continue;
    }
    prev = curr;
    curr = curr.next;
  }

  return head;
}
```
