**The If Statement**
=====================

## Summary
The if statement is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. This problem focuses on understanding the basic syntax and usage of if statements.

## Detailed Explanation
The if statement is used to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specific condition is true or false. The general syntax for an if statement is as follows:
```python
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```
Here, `condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. The code inside the `if` block will only execute if the condition is `true`, and the code in the `else` block will execute if the condition is `false`.

To illustrate this concept, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to print "Hello" if a variable `x` is greater than 5, and "Goodbye" otherwise.

Here's how you can implement this using an if statement:
```python
x = 7

if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
} else {
    System.out.println("Goodbye");
}
```
In this example, the condition `x > 5` is evaluated. Since `x` is indeed greater than 5, the code inside the `if` block will execute, printing "Hello".

Now let's analyze the time and space complexity of our solution:

* Time Complexity: O(1) because we're just executing a few lines of code.
* Space Complexity: O(1) since we're not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class IfStatement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 7;
        if (x > 5) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Goodbye");
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
x = 7

if x > 5:
    print("Hello")
else:
    print("Goodbye")
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 7;
    if (x > 5) {
        std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Goodbye" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
let x = 7;

if (x > 5) {
    console.log("Hello");
} else {
    console.log("Goodbye");
}
```

In all the above solutions, we're using the if statement to execute different blocks of code based on whether `x` is greater than 5 or not.
