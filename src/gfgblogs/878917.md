Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the GCD problem:

**GCD**
==

### Summary
The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) problem involves finding the largest positive integer that divides two given numbers without leaving a remainder. This fundamental concept in number theory has numerous applications in various areas of computer science and mathematics.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two integers. The basic idea is to repeatedly apply the following steps:

1.  If one number is zero, return the other number as the GCD.
2.  Otherwise, replace the larger number with the difference between the two numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

*   Initialize `a` and `b` as the input integers.
*   While `b` is not zero:
    *   Calculate `r` as the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
    *   Update `a` to be `b`, and `b` to be `r`.
*   Return `a` as the GCD.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(min(a, b))), where `min(a, b)` is the minimum of the two input integers. This is because each iteration reduces the magnitude of one of the numbers by a factor of at least 2. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need a few variables to store the intermediate results.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class GCD {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int r = a % b;
            a = b;
            b = r;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        r = a % b
        a = b
        b = r
    return a
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int r = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = r;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "GCD of 12 and 15 is: " << gcd(12, 15) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        let r = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = r;
    }
    return a;
}

console.log("GCD of 12 and 15 is: " + gcd(12, 15));
```

These optimized solutions demonstrate the Euclidean algorithm in different programming languages.
