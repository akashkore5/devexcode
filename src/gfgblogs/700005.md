**Reverse a linked list**
=====================

### Summary
Reverse a singly linked list. A singly linked list is defined as follows: Each element in the linked list contains a data field to hold the integer value stored in the node and a reference (i.e., "link") part that points to the next node in the sequence of nodes.

### Detailed Explanation
The problem is about reversing a singly linked list. We will solve this by creating a new head for the reversed list, traversing the original list, and updating the pointers as we go. The steps are:

1.  Initialize three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next`. Set `prev` to null (since there is no previous node initially), set `current` to the head of the linked list, and set `next` to null.
2.  Traverse the linked list until we reach the end. For each node:
    *   Update `next` to be the next node in the original list.
    *   Update `current.next` to point to `prev`. This effectively reverses the link between the current node and the next one.
    *   Move `prev` and `current` one step forward. At the end of the loop, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.
3.  Set the head of the reversed list to `prev`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Space complexity: O(1) as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public static Node reverseList(Node head) {
        Node prev = null;
        Node current = head;
        Node next = null;

        while (current != null) {
            next = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = next;
        }

        return prev;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    next = None

    while current is not None:
        next = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next

    return prev
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int data) : data(data), next(nullptr) {}
};

Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    Node* current = head;
    Node* next = nullptr;

    while (current != nullptr) {
        next = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }

    return prev;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

function reverseList(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let current = head;
    let next = null;

    while (current !== null) {
        next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }

    return prev;
}
```
