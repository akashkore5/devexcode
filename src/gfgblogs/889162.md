Here is the detailed Markdown blog post for the problem "Check if two strings are same or not":

# Check if two strings are same or not

## Summary

This problem involves checking whether two given strings are identical or not. The key concept involved here is string comparison, which requires comparing each character of both strings and determining if they match.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that compares each character of the two strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize a variable `same` to `true`.
2. Loop through each character of both strings.
3. Compare each pair of characters. If they don't match, set `same` to `false` and break out of the loop.
4. After looping through all characters, if `same` is still `true`, return that the two strings are identical.

Here's a simple ASCII art diagram to illustrate this:

```
String 1: "hello"
String 2: "hello"

 Loop through each character:
 h -> h (match)
 e -> e (match)
 l -> l (match)
 l -> l (match)
 o -> o (match)

 same = true
```

Time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the strings, as we need to compare each character once. Space complexity is O(1), as we only require a single variable to store the result.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java

```java
public boolean areStringsSame(String s1, String s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
        if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Python

```python
def are_strings_same(s1, s2):
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return False
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            return False
    return True
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <string>

bool areStringsSame(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
        if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
function areStringsSame(s1, s2) {
    if (s1.length !== s2.length) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        if (s1[i] !== s2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

These optimized solutions are implemented in the respective languages and follow the same algorithm as described above.
