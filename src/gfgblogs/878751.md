**Geometric Progression Term**
============================

### Summary
Find the term at a given position in a geometric progression. The geometric progression is defined by an initial value and a common ratio.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for a geometric progression: `term = a * r^(n-1)`, where `a` is the initial value, `r` is the common ratio, and `n` is the position of the term. We need to calculate the term at a given position `n`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Calculate the term at position `n`: `term = a * r^(n-1)`
2. Return the calculated term

Time complexity: O(1) since we're performing constant-time operations
Space complexity: O(1) since we're not using any extra space that scales with the input size

### Optimized Solutions
#### Java
```java
public class GeometricProgression {
    public static double getTerm(double a, double r, int n) {
        return a * Math.pow(r, n - 1);
    }
}
```
#### Python
```python
class GeometricProgression:
    def get_term(self, a: float, r: float, n: int) -> float:
        return a * (r ** (n - 1))
```
#### C++
```cpp
class GeometricProgression {
public:
    double getTerm(double a, double r, int n) {
        return a * pow(r, n - 1);
    }
};
```
#### JavaScript
```javascript
class GeometricProgression {
  getTerm(a, r, n) {
    return a * Math.pow(r, n - 1);
  }
}
```
Note that the solutions are written in the respective languages and use the same formula to calculate the term.
