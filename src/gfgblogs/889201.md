# Search a Character in a String

## Summary

This problem requires you to write an algorithm that searches for a specific character in a given string. The goal is to find the first occurrence of the target character in the string and return its index.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We iterate through each character in the string and check if it matches the target character. If we find a match, we return the current index as the result.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an index variable to 0.
2. Iterate through each character `c` in the input string.
3. For each character, check if it matches the target character using a conditional statement (e.g., `if (c == targetCharacter)`).
4. If the current character matches the target character, return the current index as the result.
5. If we reach the end of the string without finding the target character, return -1 to indicate that the character was not found.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the algorithm:
```
  +---------------+
  |  Input String  |
  +---------------+
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  |  Iterate through  |
  |  each character    |
  +---------------+
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  |  Check if current  |
  |  character matches|
  |  target character  |
  +---------------+
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  |  Return index if  |
  |  match found, -1   |
  |  otherwise        |
  +---------------+
```

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables to store the index and the target character.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int searchCharacter(String s, char c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == c) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Python
```python
def search_character(s, c):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == c:
            return i
    return -1
```

### C++
```cpp
int searchCharacter(char* s, char c) {
    int i = 0;
    while (*s != '\0') {
        if (*s == c) {
            return i;
        }
        s++;
        i++;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function searchCharacter(s, c) {
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === c) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

Note that the optimized solutions are just variations of the basic algorithm and do not significantly improve the time or space complexity.
