Here is a detailed Markdown blog post for the "Static Method In Python" problem:

# Static Method In Python
## Summary
In this problem, we will explore how to define and use static methods in Python. A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It can be used without creating an object of the class.

## Detailed Explanation
To define a static method, we need to use the `@staticmethod` decorator. This method can only access static variables and cannot modify instance variables.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define a class with a static method.
2. In the static method, you can access static variables using the class name.
3. You can also call other static methods from within the static method.

Here's an example:
```
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method():
        print("This is a static method")

MyClass.my_static_method()
```

Time complexity: O(1) since we are not accessing any instance variables and space complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

## Optimized Solutions

### Python
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method():
        print("This is a static method")

MyClass.my_static_method()
```

### Java
```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void myStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method");
    }
}
// To call the static method
MyClass.myStaticMethod();
```

### C++
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static void myStaticMethod() {
        std::cout << "This is a static method" << std::endl;
    }
};
// To call the static method
MyClass::myStaticMethod();
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
    console.log("This is a static method");
  }
}
// To call the static method
MyClass.myStaticMethod();
```
