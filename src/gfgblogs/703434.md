## Summary
The problem involves counting the number of elements in a given array that are smaller than each element. This requires comparing each element with all other elements to count how many are less than it.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach is straightforward: iterate through the array and for each element, compare it with all other elements to its right (or left). Count the number of elements that are less than the current element. This will give us the total count of smaller elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the counts.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each element, iterate through the remaining elements (from right to left).
4. Compare the current element with each remaining element. If it is smaller, increment the count in `ans`.
5. Return `ans`.

Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the array. This is because for each element, we are iterating through the rest of the array.
Space complexity: O(n), as we need to store the counts in a vector.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int[] countSmaller(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int[] ans = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {
                ans[i]++;
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_smaller(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    ans = [0]*n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                ans[i] += 1
    return ans
```

### C++
```cpp
int* countSmaller(int* arr, int n) {
    int* ans = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {
                ans[i]++;
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countSmaller(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let ans = new Array(n).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {
                ans[i]++;
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Note that these solutions are not optimized and have a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient solution would use a binary search approach, but that's left as an exercise for the reader.
