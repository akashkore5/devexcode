# Print Elements of Array4910

## Summary

This problem is about printing elements of an array. Given an array, we need to print its elements in a specific order or with some conditions. This problem involves basic concepts of arrays and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation

The given array can be printed in various ways depending on the requirements. For this example, let's assume that the array needs to be printed in ascending order.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  First, sort the array in ascending order. This can be done using a sorting algorithm like bubble sort or quicksort.
2.  Once the array is sorted, iterate through it and print each element.

The time complexity for this problem would be O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity would be O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from a few variables.

Here's an example ASCII art diagram representing the sorted array:

```
 0  1  2  3
 3  2  1  0
```

In this diagram, the numbers represent the elements of the array. The top row shows the original order, and the bottom row shows the sorted order.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {4, 2, 9, 6};
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for (int i : arr) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
arr = [4, 2, 9, 6]
arr.sort()
for i in arr:
    print(i)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {4, 2, 9, 6};
    std::sort(arr, arr + sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]));
    for (int i : arr) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
let arr = [4, 2, 9, 6];
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
for (let i of arr) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

Each of these solutions sorts the array in ascending order and then prints its elements.
