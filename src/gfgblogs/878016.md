# Do-While Loop

## Summary

The problem is about implementing a do-while loop, a type of control structure used in programming to repeat a block of code while a certain condition remains true. The key concept involved is the conditional statement that determines whether the loop should continue or terminate.

## Detailed Explanation

A do-while loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code once before checking the condition, and then continues to execute the block as long as the condition remains true. This means that the loop body will always be executed at least once.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable or expression that will be used as the condition for the loop.
2. Execute the loop body (the code inside the do-while loop).
3. Check the condition. If it is true, repeat steps 2 and 3 until the condition becomes false.
4. When the condition becomes false, exit the loop.

Here's an ASCII art diagram representing a do-while loop:
```
          do {
              // loop body
          } while (condition);
```

The time complexity of a do-while loop is O(n), where n is the number of iterations, and the space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of space.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public static void doWhileExample(int num) {
    int i = 0;
    do {
        System.out.println("Current value: " + i);
        i++;
    } while (i < num);
}
```

### Python
```python
def do_while_example(num):
    i = 0
    while True:
        print(f"Current value: {i}")
        i += 1
        if i >= num:
            break
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doWhileExample(int num) {
    int i = 0;
    do {
        std::cout << "Current value: " << i << std::endl;
        i++;
    } while (i < num);
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function doWhileExample(num) {
    let i = 0;
    do {
        console.log(`Current value: ${i}`);
        i++;
    } while (i < num);
}
```
