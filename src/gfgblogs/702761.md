**Pair Array Product Sum**
=====================

## Summary
Given two arrays `A` and `B`, both of size `n`, find the total sum of products of all possible pairs of elements from each array. This problem involves arrays, data structures, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Detailed Explanation
The key concept involved in this problem is pairing up elements from each array and calculating their product. We can achieve this by iterating through both arrays simultaneously and performing pairwise multiplications. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the total sum.
2. Iterate through both arrays using two nested loops, one for each array.
3. For each pair of elements `(a, b)` from `A` and `(c, d)` from `B`, calculate their product `product = a * c + b * d`.
4. Add the product to the `sum`.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all pairs have been processed.
6. Return the total sum `sum`.

Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of each array, as we need to iterate through both arrays and perform pairwise multiplications for each pair.

Space complexity: O(1), as we only require a constant amount of space to store the sum.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int pairArrayProductSum(int[] A, int[] B) {
    int n = A.length;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i] * B[j];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Python
```python
def pair_array_product_sum(A, B):
    n = len(A)
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            sum += A[i] * B[j]
    return sum
```

### C++
```cpp
int pairArrayProductSum(int* A, int* B, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i] * B[j];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function pairArrayProductSum(A, B) {
    let n = A.length;
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i] * B[j];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```
