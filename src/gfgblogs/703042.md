# Reorganize The Array

## Summary

The problem requires you to reorganize an array such that all elements less than a given target value appear before all elements greater than or equal to the target value. This is a classic array manipulation problem that involves sorting and rearranging the elements in a specific order.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the array (let's call it `low`) and one at the end of the array (let's call it `high`). We'll also maintain a variable `target` to store the target value.

Here are the steps:

1. Start by initializing `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of the array minus 1.
2. Compare the values at indices `low` and `high`. If the value at index `low` is less than the target, increment `low` and move all elements less than the target to the beginning of the array.
3. If the value at index `high` is greater than or equal to the target, decrement `high` and move all elements greater than or equal to the target to the end of the array.
4. Continue iterating until `low` meets `high`.
5. Return the reorganized array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
```markdown
  [1, 3, 5, 2, 7] (input)
  |         |
  +---------+--------+
          low    high

  loop iteration 1:
  compare 1 and 7: less than target, increment low to 1
  move all elements < target to beginning [1]

  loop iteration 2:
  compare 3 and 5: both > target, decrement high to 4
  move all elements >= target to end [1, 2, 3, 7]

  final result: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public static int[] reorganizeArray(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        if (arr[low] < target && arr[high] >= target) {
            break;
        }
        if (arr[low] < target) {
            low++;
        } else if (arr[high] >= target) {
            high--;
        } else {
            int temp = arr[low];
            arr[low] = arr[high];
            arr[high] = temp;
            low++;
            high--;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}
```

### Python
```python
def reorganize_array(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        if arr[low] < target and arr[high] >= target:
            break
        if arr[low] < target:
            low += 1
        elif arr[high] >= target:
            high -= 1
        else:
            arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]
            low += 1
            high -= 1

    return arr
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>

int* reorganizeArray(int* arr, int target, int& length) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        if (arr[low] < target && arr[high] >= target) {
            break;
        }
        if (arr[low] < target) {
            low++;
        } else if (arr[high] >= target) {
            high--;
        } else {
            std::swap(arr[low], arr[high]);
            low++;
            high--;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function reorganizeArray(arr, target) {
  let low = 0;
  let high = arr.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    if (arr[low] < target && arr[high] >= target) {
      break;
    }
    if (arr[low] < target) {
      low++;
    } else if (arr[high] >= target) {
      high--;
    } else {
      [arr[low], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[low]];
      low++;
      high--;
    }
  }

  return arr;
}
```
