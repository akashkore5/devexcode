## Summary
The Roof Top problem involves finding the maximum height of a rooftop that can be built given certain constraints. The key concepts involved are arrays and searching.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem statement is not provided, but we can assume it's about building rooftops with a specific condition: each rooftop must have at least one window on every floor, and all windows must be of the same size. We need to find the maximum height of the rooftop that satisfies this condition.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. Initialize a variable `max_height` to 0 and iterate over the array of window sizes. For each window size, check if it's possible to build a rooftop of that height by checking if all previous windows are of the same size as the current one. If it is, update `max_height` with the new value. Finally, return `max_height`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize `max_height` to 0.
2. Iterate over the array of window sizes.
3. For each window size:
   - Check if all previous windows are of the same size as the current one.
   - If they are, update `max_height` with the new value.
4. Return `max_height`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of window sizes in the array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store `max_height`.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int maxRoofHeight(int[] windows) {
    int max_height = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < windows.length; i++) {
        if (i == 0 || windows[i] == windows[i - 1]) {
            max_height = i + 1;
        }
    }
    return max_height;
}
```

### Python
```python
def max_roof_height(windows):
    max_height = 0
    for i in range(len(windows)):
        if i == 0 or windows[i] == windows[i - 1]:
            max_height = i + 1
    return max_height
```

### C++
```cpp
int maxRoofHeight(int* windows, int n) {
    int max_height = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i == 0 || windows[i] == windows[i - 1]) {
            max_height = i + 1;
        }
    }
    return max_height;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function maxRoofHeight(windows) {
    let max_height = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < windows.length; i++) {
        if (i === 0 || windows[i] === windows[i - 1]) {
            max_height = i + 1;
        }
    }
    return max_height;
}
```
