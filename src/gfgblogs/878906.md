**Print Square Wall Using Nested Loops**
=====================================

## Summary
The problem requires you to print a square wall using nested loops. The goal is to print a square shape with asterisks (*) using a specific pattern, where each row and column has the same number of asterisks.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the square. We start by initializing an integer variable `n` to represent the size of the square. Then, we use two nested loops: one for the rows and another for the columns.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an integer variable `n` to represent the size of the square.
2. Use a loop to iterate over each row in the square:
	* For each row, use another loop to iterate over each column.
	* Print an asterisk (*) for each column, except for the first and last columns (which should be blank).
3. After each row is printed, print a newline character to move to the next line.

Here's an ASCII art diagram of the output:
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where `n` is the size of the square. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need a constant amount of space to store the variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class PrintSquareWall {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // Size of the square
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == n - 1) {
                    System.out.print("* ");
                } else {
                    System.out.print("  ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def print_square_wall(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == n - 1 or j == n - 1:
                print("* ", end="")
            else:
                print("  ", end="")
        print()

print_square_wall(5)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printSquareWall(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == n - 1) {
                std::cout << "* ";
            } else {
                std::cout << "  ";
            }
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Size of the square
    printSquareWall(n);
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function printSquareWall(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == n - 1) {
                console.log("* ");
            } else {
                console.log("  ");
            }
        }
    }
}

printSquareWall(5);
```

Each of these solutions uses nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the square, printing an asterisk (*) for each column except for the first and last columns. The output is a square shape with asterisks (*).
