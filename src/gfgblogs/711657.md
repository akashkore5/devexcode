**Pattern 5**
==Triangles, anyone?==
#711657

### Summary
Generate a triangle pattern of asterisks (*) using a given input integer `n`. The pattern should have `n` levels. For example, if `n` is 3, the output would be:

```
*
***
*****
```

The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an input value.

### Detailed Explanation
To generate this pattern, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates from level 1 to `n`. At each level, we print the number of asterisks required for that level. We start with 1 asterisk at level 1, then 3 asterisks at level 2, and so on.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an integer variable `i` to 1.
2. Loop until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. Print `i` number of asterisks (`*`) followed by a newline character (`\n`).
4. Increment `i` by 2 for the next iteration.

Time complexity: O(n), as we only iterate `n` times.
Space complexity: O(1), as we don't use any extra space that scales with input size.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public static void printTriangle(int n) {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= n) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            System.out.print("*");
        }
        System.out.println();
        i += 2;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def print_triangle(n):
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        print("*" * i)
        i += 2
```

#### C++
```cpp
void printTriangle(int n) {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= n) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            std::cout << "*";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
        i += 2;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function printTriangle(n) {
    let i = 1;
    while (i <= n) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            console.log("*");
        }
        i += 2;
    }
}
```
