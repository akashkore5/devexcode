# Nth Catalan Number

## Summary

The problem involves calculating the nth Catalan number, which is a sequence of natural numbers that arise in various counting problems. The key concept involved is dynamic programming.

## Detailed Explanation

To calculate the nth Catalan number, we can use dynamic programming to optimize our solution. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an array `C` with `n+1` elements, where `C[i]` will store the ith Catalan number.
2. Set `C[0] = 1`, as the 0th Catalan number is by definition 1.
3. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, calculate `C[i]` using the recurrence relation: `C[i] = sum(C[j] * C[k]) for j = 0 to i-1 and k = i-j-1`.
4. Return `C[n]` as the nth Catalan number.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the recurrence relation:

```
    +---------------+
    |      C[3]     |
    +---------------+
           |
           |
       +---------------+
       |  sum(C[j] * C[k])  |
       |  for j = 0 to i-1  |
       |  and k = i-j-1    |
       +---------------+
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), as we need to iterate up to `n` and calculate the sum for each `i`. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the Catalan numbers in an array.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class NthCatalanNumber {
    public static int nthCatalan(int n) {
        int[] C = new int[n + 1];
        C[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            C[i] = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                C[i] += C[j] * C[i - j - 1];
            }
        }
        return C[n];
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def nth_catalan(n):
    C = [0] * (n + 1)
    C[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        C[i] = sum(C[j] * C[i - j - 1] for j in range(i))
    return C[n]
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>

int nthCatalan(int n) {
    std::vector<int> C(n + 1, 0);
    C[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        C[i] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            C[i] += C[j] * C[i - j - 1];
        }
    }
    return C[n];
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function nthCatalan(n) {
    const C = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    C[0] = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        C[i] = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            C[i] += C[j] * C[i - j - 1];
        }
    }
    return C[n];
}
```
