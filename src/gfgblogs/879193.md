**Kth smallest element**
=====================

## Summary
Find the kth smallest element in an array. This problem is about manipulating and searching a collection of elements, specifically finding the kth smallest element in a given array. The key concepts involved are data structures and algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to solve this problem involves using a priority queue or heap data structure. We can use either a min-heap or max-heap depending on whether we want to find the kth largest or kth smallest element, respectively.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  Initialize an empty priority queue.
2.  Iterate over the array and push each element into the priority queue.
3.  Extract the top (smallest) element from the priority queue k-1 times.
4.  The kth smallest element will be the next element extracted from the priority queue, which is at the top.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each insertion and extraction operation takes O(log n) time, and we perform these operations n times.

Space complexity: O(n) for storing all elements in the priority queue.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
import java.util.*;

public class KthSmallest {
    public static int findKthSmallest(int[] arr, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            minHeap.offer(num);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            minHeap.poll();
        }
        
        return minHeap.peek();
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
import heapq

def find_kth_smallest(arr, k):
    min_heap = []
    
    for num in arr:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        
    for i in range(k - 1):
        heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
    return heapq.nsmallest(1, min_heap)[0]
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

int findKthSmallest(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    std::priority_queue<int> minHeap;
    
    for (int num : arr) {
        minHeap.push(num);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
        minHeap.pop();
    }
    
    return minHeap.top();
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findKthSmallest(arr, k) {
    let minHeap = [];
    
    arr.forEach(num => {
        minHeap.push(num);
    });
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
        minHeap.shift();
    }
    
    return minHeap[0];
}
```

Note: The code snippets provided are optimized solutions for the problem. However, please note that they might not be the most efficient or practical solutions for large inputs due to the overhead of using priority queues.
