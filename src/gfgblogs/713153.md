**Minimum X (xor) A -- 170645**
### Medium

## Summary
Given an array A of size N, find the minimum value that can be obtained by performing bitwise XOR operation on all elements in the array. The problem requires us to use Bit Magic and Data Structures concepts to solve it efficiently.

## Detailed Explanation
The given problem is a classic example of using bit manipulation to solve a complex problem. To solve this problem, we will first calculate the XOR of all elements in the array. Then, we can find the minimum value that can be obtained by performing bitwise XOR operation on all elements in the array.

To do this, we will use two variables: `xor_sum` and `min_xor`. `xor_sum` will store the sum of all bits in the array (i.e., the sum of 1's and 0's). `min_xor` will store the minimum value that can be obtained by performing bitwise XOR operation on all elements in the array.

We initialize `xor_sum` as 0, since there are no bits yet. Then, we iterate over each element in the array, updating `xor_sum` with the sum of its bits and the previous `xor_sum`. After iterating over all elements, `xor_sum` will store the sum of all bits in the array.

To find `min_xor`, we initialize it as the last bit of `xor_sum`. This is because the minimum value that can be obtained by performing bitwise XOR operation on all elements in the array must have the same number of 1's and 0's as the sum of all bits in the array, since each element has either 0 or 1 bits.

Finally, we return `min_xor` as the result. This solution takes O(N) time complexity, where N is the size of the array, since it iterates over each element once.

### Time Complexity: O(N)
### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int findMinXor(int[] A) {
    int xor_sum = 0;
    for (int i : A) {
        xor_sum ^= i;
    }
    int min_xor = xor_sum & -xor_sum; // Find the rightmost set bit in xor_sum
    return min_xor;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def find_min_xor(A):
    xor_sum = 0
    for i in A:
        xor_sum ^= i
    min_xor = xor_sum & -xor_sum  # Find the rightmost set bit in xor_sum
    return min_xor
```

#### C++
```cpp
int findMinXor(int A[], int n) {
    int xor_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        xor_sum ^= A[i];
    }
    int min_xor = xor_sum & -xor_sum; // Find the rightmost set bit in xor_sum
    return min_xor;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function findMinXor(A) {
    let xor_sum = 0;
    for (let i of A) {
        xor_sum ^= i;
    }
    let min_xor = xor_sum & -xor_sum; // Find the rightmost set bit in xor_sum
    return min_xor;
}
```
