**Assign Cookies**
=====================================================

## Summary
The "Assign Cookies" problem is an easy algorithmic challenge that involves sorting and arrays. Given two integer arrays, `cookies` and `kids`, where each element in `cookies` represents the number of cookies a kid wants, and each element in `kids` represents the age of the kids, we need to assign cookies to the kids such that the difference between the maximum and minimum number of cookies assigned is minimized. The problem requires us to write an algorithm that solves this problem efficiently.

## Detailed Explanation
The key insight here is that we can sort both arrays based on their values. This allows us to pair up the smallest kid with the largest number of cookies, the second-smallest kid with the second-largest number of cookies, and so on. This way, we ensure that each kid gets at least one cookie, and the difference between the maximum and minimum number of cookies assigned is minimized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  Sort both `cookies` and `kids` arrays in ascending order.
2.  Initialize two pointers, `i` for `cookies` and `j` for `kids`, to the start of their respective arrays.
3.  While `i` is less than the length of `cookies` and `j` is less than the length of `kids`:
    *   Assign the cookie at index `i` to the kid at index `j`.
    *   Increment `i` and decrement `j`. If `j` becomes zero, break the loop.
4.  Return the difference between the maximum and minimum number of cookies assigned.

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Space complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public class AssignCookies {
    public static int assignCookies(int[] cookies, int[] kids) {
        Arrays.sort(cookies);
        Arrays.sort(kids);
        
        int i = 0, j = kids.length - 1;
        int maxDiff = 0;
        
        while (i < cookies.length && j >= 0) {
            int cookie = cookies[i];
            int kid = kids[j];
            
            if (cookie > kid) {
                return Math.abs(cookie - kid);
            }
            
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        
        return maxDiff;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def assign_cookies(cookies, kids):
    cookies.sort()
    kids.sort()
    
    i = 0
    j = len(kids) - 1
    
    max_diff = 0
    
    while i < len(cookies) and j >= 0:
        cookie = cookies[i]
        kid = kids[j]
        
        if cookie > kid:
            return abs(cookie - kid)
        
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    
    return max_diff
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int assignCookies(std::vector<int>& cookies, std::vector<int>& kids) {
    std::sort(cookies.begin(), cookies.end());
    std::sort(kids.begin(), kids.end());
    
    int i = 0, j = kids.size() - 1;
    int maxDiff = 0;
    
    while (i < cookies.size() && j >= 0) {
        int cookie = cookies[i];
        int kid = kids[j];
        
        if (cookie > kid) {
            return std::abs(cookie - kid);
        }
        
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    
    return maxDiff;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function assignCookies(cookies, kids) {
  cookies.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  kids.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  let i = 0, j = kids.length - 1;
  let maxDiff = 0;
  
  while (i < cookies.length && j >= 0) {
    const cookie = cookies[i];
    const kid = kids[j];
    
    if (cookie > kid) {
      return Math.abs(cookie - kid);
    }
    
    i++;
    j--;
  }
  
  return maxDiff;
}
```
