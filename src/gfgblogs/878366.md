## Summary
Given a sequence of non-negative integers, count the number of zeros in the sequence. This problem is related to searching and data structures as we need to iterate through the array to find the count.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simply loop through the array and add 1 to our counter each time we encounter a zero. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of zeros.
2. Iterate through the given sequence using a for loop or any other suitable method.
3. Inside the loop, check if the current element is equal to 0. If it is, increment the `count` by 1.
4. Continue this process until all elements in the sequence have been processed.
5. The final value of `count` will be the total number of zeros in the sequence.

Here's a diagram illustrating the steps:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Sequence: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  v
     Initialize count = 0
                  |
                  v
     Loop through sequence:
       - Check if current element is 0. If yes, increment count.
       - Continue until end of sequence.
                  |
                  v
     Return the final value of count: 2
```
Time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. Space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int countZeros(int[] arr) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (num == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_zeros(arr):
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

### C++
```cpp
int countZeros(int* arr, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countZeros(arr) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
These optimized solutions iterate through the input array to find the number of zeros, making them efficient and scalable.
