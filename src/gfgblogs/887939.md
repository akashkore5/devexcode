**Sum of Squares of First n Natural Numbers**
===============

## Summary
Given a positive integer `n`, find the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. This problem is a classic example of a mathematical algorithm, where we need to calculate the sum of squares of integers from 1 to `n`.

## Detailed Explanation
The key concept involved in this problem is the formula for the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. The formula is given by:

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = Î£(i^2) from i=1 to n

To calculate the sum, we can use a simple loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, and at each iteration, we add the square of the current number to our running total.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate from 1 to `n`.
3. At each iteration, calculate the square of the current number (`i`) and add it to `sum`.
4. Return `sum` as the result.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int sumOfSquares(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i * i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Python
```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i ** 2
    return sum
```

### C++
```cpp
int sumOfSquares(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i * i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumOfSquares(n) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i ** 2;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Note that all the optimized solutions are similar, with the main difference being the syntax and language-specific features.
