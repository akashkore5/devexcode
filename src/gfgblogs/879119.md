**Multi Printing**
================

### Summary
The problem is about printing multiple strings in a specific order, given a list of strings and their corresponding print orders. The goal is to find an optimal way to print all the strings according to their original order.

### Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We iterate over the input list of strings, and for each string, we check its print order. If it's time to print that string (i.e., its turn in the print order), we print it. Otherwise, we skip printing it.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the printed strings.
2. Iterate over the input list of strings.
3. For each string:
   - Check if it's time to print that string (i.e., its turn in the print order).
   - If it is, add it to the `result` list and increment a counter for the current print order.
4. Repeat step 3 until all strings have been processed.
5. Return the `result` list.

### Optimized Solutions
#### Java
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public List<String> multiPrint(List<String> strings) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int currentOrder = 0;

    for (String s : strings) {
        if (s.startsWith(String.valueOf(currentOrder))) {
            result.add(s);
            currentOrder++;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def multi_print(strings):
    result = []
    current_order = 0

    for s in strings:
        if str(current_order) in s:
            result.append(s)
            current_order += 1

    return result
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<std::string> multiPrint(const std::vector<std::string>& strings) {
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    int currentOrder = 0;

    for (const auto& s : strings) {
        if (s.find(std::to_string(currentOrder)) != std::string::npos) {
            result.push_back(s);
            currentOrder++;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function multiPrint(strings) {
  let result = [];
  let currentOrder = 0;

  for (let s of strings) {
    if (s.includes(String(currentOrder))) {
      result.push(s);
      currentOrder++;
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```
All solutions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the printed strings in the `result` list.
