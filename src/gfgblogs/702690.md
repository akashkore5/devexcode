# Count number of elements between two given elements in array

## Summary
This problem involves counting the number of elements in an array that are between two given elements. The problem requires a basic understanding of arrays and hash data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to solve this problem is to create a hash table where the keys are the array elements and the values are their corresponding indices. Then, we iterate through the array and for each element, we calculate its difference with the given elements (let's say, `target1` and `target2`). If an element's difference with both targets is positive, it means that this element is between `target1` and `target2`. We count the number of such elements and return the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Create a hash table where the keys are the array elements and the values are their corresponding indices.
2. Iterate through the array and for each element, calculate its difference with both `target1` and `target2`.
3. If an element's difference with both targets is positive, increment a counter variable.
4. Return the value of the counter variable.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we're iterating through the array once.

Space complexity: O(n), as we're using a hash table to store the array elements and their indices.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the steps:

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static int countElements(int[] arr, int target1, int target2) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            map.put(arr[i], i);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if ((arr[i] - target1) > 0 && (target2 - arr[i]) > 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_elements(arr, target1, target2):
    map = {}
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        map[arr[i]] = i
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if (arr[i] - target1) > 0 and (target2 - arr[i]) > 0:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

int countElements(std::vector<int>& arr, int target1, int target2) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> map;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        map[arr[i]] = i;
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if ((arr[i] - target1) > 0 && (target2 - arr[i]) > 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countElements(arr, target1, target2) {
    let map = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        map[arr[i]] = i;
    }
    
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if ((arr[i] - target1) > 0 && (target2 - arr[i]) > 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
