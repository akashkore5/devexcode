**Rotating an Array**
=====================================================

## Summary
Given an array of integers, rotate it by a certain number of positions. For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and we want to rotate it by 2 positions, the output would be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`. This problem involves basic algorithms and data structures.

## Detailed Explanation
The goal of this problem is to write a function that takes an array of integers and a number of positions as input, and returns the rotated array. We can solve this problem by using a simple algorithm that shifts the elements of the array by the given number of positions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Take the input array and the number of positions as input.
2. Create a new array to store the rotated result.
3. Copy the last `n` (number of positions) elements from the original array to the beginning of the new array, where `n` is the number of positions.
4. Copy the remaining elements from the original array to the end of the new array.

Here's an ASCII art diagram to illustrate the process:
```
Original Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Rotate by 2:

Last 2 elements -> [4, 5] (move them to the beginning)
Remaining elements -> [1, 2, 3]

New Array: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We need to iterate through the entire array once.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the rotated result.

## Optimized Solutions
Here are optimized solutions in different programming languages:

### Java
```java
public int[] rotateArray(int[] arr, int n) {
    int[] result = new int[arr.length];
    for (int i = n; i < arr.length; i++) {
        result[i - n] = arr[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = arr[arr.length - n + i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Python
```python
def rotate_array(arr, n):
    result = [0] * len(arr)
    for i in range(n, len(arr)):
        result[i - n] = arr[i]
    for i in range(len(arr) - n):
        result[i] = arr[-n + i]
    return result
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int* rotateArray(int* arr, int n, int& size) {
    int* result = new int[size];
    for (int i = n; i < size; i++) {
        result[i - n] = arr[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = arr[size - n + i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function rotateArray(arr, n) {
    let result = new Array(arr.length);
    for (let i = n; i < arr.length; i++) {
        result[i - n] = arr[i];
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = arr[arr.length - n + i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

These optimized solutions have the same time and space complexity as the basic solution, but they are more efficient in terms of code length and readability.
