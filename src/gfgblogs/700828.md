### Summary
Counting Special Characters is an easy problem that involves counting the number of special characters in a given string. The problem requires you to write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the count of special characters in it.

### Detailed Explanation
The algorithm for this problem is quite straightforward. We can iterate over each character in the string and check if it's a special character or not. A special character is typically defined as any character that's not an alphabet (both lowercase and uppercase) or a digit.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `specialCount` to 0, which will store the count of special characters.
2. Iterate over each character in the string using a loop.
3. For each character, check if it's a special character by using a conditional statement (e.g., `if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c))`). If the character is not a letter or digit, increment `specialCount`.
4. After the loop, return the value of `specialCount` as the result.

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we're iterating over each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the count of special characters.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int countSpecialChars(String str) {
    int specialCount = 0;
    for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
        if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) {
            specialCount++;
        }
    }
    return specialCount;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def count_special_chars(s):
    return sum(1 for c in s if not c.isalnum())
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int countSpecialChars(std::string str) {
    int specialCount = 0;
    for (char c : str) {
        if (!std::isalnum(c)) {
            specialCount++;
        }
    }
    return specialCount;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function countSpecialChars(str) {
    let specialCount = 0;
    for (let c of str) {
        if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(String(c))) {
            specialCount++;
        }
    }
    return specialCount;
}
```
