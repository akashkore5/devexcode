## Summary
Given a sequence of integers, the task is to find the longest subsequence that forms a Fibonacci-like series. The Fibonacci series starts with two numbers (usually 0 and 1), and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. For example, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] is a Fibonacci sequence.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the given sequence and maintaining two variables, `prev` and `curr`, which represent the last two numbers in the Fibonacci-like series. For each number in the sequence, check if it's equal to the sum of `prev` and `curr`. If it is, increment the length of the subsequence and update `prev` and `curr`. Otherwise, move on to the next number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize `prev`, `curr`, and the subsequence length to 0.
2. Iterate through the sequence:
    * For each number, check if it's equal to the sum of `prev` and `curr`.
    * If it is, increment the subsequence length and update `prev` and `curr`. Otherwise, move on to the next number.
3. Return the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence found.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only need a few extra variables to store the current state of the subsequence.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class LargestFibonacciSubsequence {
    public static int largestFibonacciSubsequence(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int prev = 0, curr = 1, maxLength = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == prev + curr) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = num;
                maxLength++;
            } else {
                prev = num;
                curr = num;
                maxLength = 1;
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def largest_fibonacci_subsequence(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    max_length = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num == prev + curr:
            prev, curr = curr, num
            max_length += 1
        else:
            prev, curr = num, num
            max_length = 1
    return max_length
```

### C++
```cpp
class LargestFibonacciSubsequence {
public:
    int largestFibonacciSubsequence(vector<int> nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int prev = 0, curr = 1, maxLength = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == prev + curr) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = num;
                maxLength++;
            } else {
                prev = num;
                curr = num;
                maxLength = 1;
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function largestFibonacciSubsequence(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let prev = 0, curr = 1, maxLength = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === prev + curr) {
            prev = curr;
            curr = num;
            maxLength++;
        } else {
            prev = num;
            curr = num;
            maxLength = 1;
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

Note: The problem description does not specify the type of sequence, so we assume it's a Fibonacci-like series.
