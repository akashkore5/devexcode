# Surpasser Count

## Summary
The Surpasser Count problem involves finding the number of elements in an array that are greater than a given element. This problem requires understanding basic array manipulation and comparison techniques.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and count the number of elements that are greater than the given element. We start by initializing a counter to zero. Then, for each element in the array, we compare it with the given element. If the current element is greater, we increment the counter.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each element `arr[i]`, compare it with the given element `target`.
4. If `arr[i] > target`, increment the `count` variable by 1.
5. Return the final value of `count`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we're iterating through the array once.

Space complexity: O(1), as we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int surpasserCount(int[] arr, int target) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Python
```python
def surpasser_count(arr, target):
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num > target:
            count += 1
    return count
```

### C++
```cpp
int surpasserCount(int* arr, int target, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function surpasserCount(arr, target) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num > target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
These optimized solutions use the same algorithm as described above and iterate through the array once to find the number of elements that are greater than the given element.
