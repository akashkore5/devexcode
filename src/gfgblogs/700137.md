**Reverse a Doubly Linked List**

## Summary
Given a doubly linked list (DLL), the task is to reverse the DLL. A doubly linked list has nodes with two pointers - one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Start from the head of the list.
2. Store the current node in a temporary variable.
3. Move the current pointer to the next node (i.e., `curr = curr->next;`).
4. Update the `prev` and `next` pointers for the stored node (`stored->prev = curr; stored->next = curr->next; curr->next = stored;`).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until we reach the end of the list.
6. At the end, update the head pointer to point to the new first node (i.e., `head = stored;`).

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the DLL, and a space complexity of O(1) as we only use a few extra variables.

Here's an ASCII art diagram of the process:
```
   +-------+       +-------+
   |  A  | --> |  B  | --> ... --> Z
   +-------+       +-------+

  (initial list)

   +-------+       +-------+
   |  Z  | <-- | Y  | <-- ... <-- A
   +-------+       +-------+

  (reversed list)
```

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node prev, next;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.prev = null;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static Node reverse(Node head) {
        Node prev = null;
        Node curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            Node stored = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            stored.prev = curr;
            stored.next = prev;
            prev = stored;
        }
        return prev;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        Node head = new Node(1);
        head.next = new Node(2);
        head.next.prev = head;
        head.next.next = new Node(3);
        head.next.next.prev = head.next;

        Node reversedHead = reverse(head);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

def reverse(head):
    prev = None
    curr = head
    while curr is not None:
        stored = curr
        curr = curr.next
        stored.prev = curr
        stored.next = prev
        prev = stored
    return prev

# Example usage
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.prev = head
head.next.next = Node(3)
head.next.next.prev = head.next

reversed_head = reverse(head)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* prev, *next;

    Node(int data) : data(data), prev(nullptr), next(nullptr) {}
};

Node* reverse(Node* head) {
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    Node* curr = head;
    while (curr != nullptr) {
        Node* stored = curr;
        curr = curr->next;
        stored->prev = curr;
        stored->next = prev;
        prev = stored;
    }
    return prev;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    head->next = new Node(2);
    head->next->prev = head;
    head->next->next = new Node(3);
    head->next->next->prev = head->next;

    Node* reversedHead = reverse(head);

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.prev = null;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

function reverse(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let curr = head;
    while (curr !== null) {
        let stored = curr;
        curr = curr.next;
        stored.prev = curr;
        stored.next = prev;
        prev = stored;
    }
    return prev;
}

// Example usage
let head = new Node(1);
head.next = new Node(2);
head.next.prev = head;
head.next.next = new Node(3);
head.next.next.prev = head.next;

let reversedHead = reverse(head);
```
