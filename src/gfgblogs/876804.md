### Summary
Given two sorted arrays `A` and `B`, both containing distinct elements, find their intersection. The intersection of two sets A and B is a set of elements which are present in both A and B.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of two-pointer technique. Initialize two pointers, one for each array. Start by comparing the elements at these pointers. If the elements are equal, it means that this element is common to both arrays, so add it to our result set and move both pointers forward. If the elements are not equal, move the pointer of the smaller element forward.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j`, each pointing to the beginning of array `A` and `B`, respectively.
2. Compare the elements at indices `i` and `j`. If they are equal, it means that this element is common to both arrays, so add it to our result set and increment both `i` and `j`.
3. If the elements are not equal, move the pointer of the smaller element forward. This is because we know that all elements in the intersection must be less than or equal to the maximum element in either array.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until one of the arrays is exhausted.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m+n), where `m` and `n` are the sizes of the input arrays. The space complexity is O(min(m, n)), as we need to store at most min(m, n) elements in our result set.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int[] intersection(int[] A, int[] B) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    
    while (i < A.length && j < B.length) {
        if (A[i] == B[j]) {
            result.add(A[i]);
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (A[i] < B[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    int[] arr = new int[result.size()];
    for (int k = 0; k < result.size(); k++) {
        arr[k] = result.get(k);
    }
    
    return arr;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def intersection(A, B):
    i = j = 0
    result = []
    
    while i < len(A) and j < len(B):
        if A[i] == B[j]:
            result.append(A[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif A[i] < B[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    return list(result)
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> intersection(std::vector<int>& A, std::vector<int>& B) {
    auto itA = A.begin();
    auto itB = B.begin();
    
    while (itA != A.end() && itB != B.end()) {
        if (*itA == *itB) {
            result.push_back(*itA);
            ++itA;
            ++itB;
        } else if (*itA < *itB) {
            ++itA;
        } else {
            ++itB;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function intersection(A, B) {
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;
    let result = [];
    
    while (i < A.length && j < B.length) {
        if (A[i] === B[j]) {
            result.push(A[i]);
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (A[i] < B[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

Please note that these solutions assume the arrays are sorted and contain distinct elements.
