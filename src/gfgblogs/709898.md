**Optimum location of point to minimize total distance**
=====================================================

## Summary
Given a set of points on a plane, find the optimal location that minimizes the total distance from this point to all other points. This problem is a classic example of optimization in computational geometry.

## Detailed Explanation
The key concept involved in this problem is the idea of minimizing the total distance between a fixed point and all other points in a given set. We can approach this problem by using the concept of centroids, which are the average positions of all points.

Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Calculate the centroid (x, y) of the given set of points.
2. For each point P(x, y), calculate its distance from the centroid using the Euclidean distance formula: sqrt((x - x_centroid)^2 + (y - y_centroid)^2).
3. Return the centroid as the optimal location that minimizes the total distance.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of points in the given set. This is because we need to iterate through each point once to calculate its distance from the centroid and then return the centroid.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only require a constant amount of space to store the centroid coordinates.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public class OptimumLocation {
    public static Point findOptimalLocation(Point[] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        double sumX = 0, sumY = 0;

        for (Point point : points) {
            sumX += point.x;
            sumY += point.y;
        }

        double centroidX = sumX / n;
        double centroidY = sumY / n;

        return new Point(centroidX, centroidY);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_optimal_location(points):
    n = len(points)
    sum_x = 0
    sum_y = 0

    for point in points:
        sum_x += point[0]
        sum_y += point[1]

    centroid_x = sum_x / n
    centroid_y = sum_y / n

    return (centroid_x, centroid_y)
```

### C++
```cpp
class OptimumLocation {
public:
    Point findOptimalLocation(vector<Point> points) {
        int n = points.size();
        double sumX = 0, sumY = 0;

        for (Point point : points) {
            sumX += point.x;
            sumY += point.y;
        }

        double centroidX = sumX / n;
        double centroidY = sumY / n;

        return Point(centroidX, centroidY);
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findOptimalLocation(points) {
    let n = points.length;
    let sumX = 0, sumY = 0;

    for (let point of points) {
        sumX += point[0];
        sumY += point[1];
    }

    let centroidX = sumX / n;
    let centroidY = sumY / n;

    return [centroidX, centroidY];
}
```
Note that the `Point` class is assumed to have `x` and `y` attributes representing its coordinates.
