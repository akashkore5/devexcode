# Tribonacci Number

## Summary

The Tribonacci number is a sequence that generalizes the Fibonacci sequence. In this problem, we need to find the nth Tribonacci number, which is defined as the sum of the last three terms in the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, ... . This problem involves understanding the concept of recursion and dynamic programming.

## Detailed Explanation

The Tribonacci sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but instead of adding the last two terms, we add the last three. The base cases are the first three terms: 0, 1, and 1. To generate the next term, we sum the last three terms in the sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Define a function `tribonacci(n)` that returns the nth Tribonacci number.
* Base case: If `n` is less than or equal to 2, return 0 (since the first two terms are 0 and 1).
* Recursive case: For `n` greater than 2, calculate the `n`th Tribonacci number as the sum of the `(n-1)`th, `(n-2)`th, and `(n-3)`th numbers.
* Use dynamic programming to store the results of previously calculated Tribonacci numbers and avoid redundant calculations.

The time complexity is O(n), since we need to calculate each term in the sequence. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing the results of previously calculated terms.

Here's an ASCII art diagram representing the Tribonacci sequence:

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Tribonacci {
    public static int tribonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return 0;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def tribonacci(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0], dp[1], dp[2] = 0, 1, 1
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]
    return dp[n]
```

### C++
```cpp
class Tribonacci {
public:
    int tribonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return 0;
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function tribonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return 0;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1; dp[2] = 1;
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```
