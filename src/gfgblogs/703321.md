**Fill Array with 1's**
=====================================================

## Summary
Given an array of integers, fill it with 1's. This problem is about manipulating arrays and has no specific tags indicating dynamic programming or trees, so we can assume a general algorithmic problem.

## Detailed Explanation
The approach to solve this problem involves iterating through the array and assigning each element a value of 1. The step-by-step breakdown of the solution is as follows:

1. Initialize an integer variable `n` with the length of the input array.
2. Create a loop that runs from `0` to `n-1`.
3. Inside the loop, assign the value `1` to each element in the array at index `i`, where `i` is the current iteration.
4. After the loop finishes, return the filled array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we are performing a single pass through the array. The space complexity is also O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the array and variable `n`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram showing the filled array:

```
[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int[] fillArrayWithOnes(int n) {
    int[] arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = 1;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

### Python
```python
def fill_array_with_ones(n):
    arr = [1]*n
    return arr
```

### C++
```cpp
vector<int> fillArrayWithOnes(int n) {
    vector<int> arr(n, 1);
    return arr;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function fillArrayWithOnes(n) {
    let arr = new Array(n).fill(1);
    return arr;
}
```
