**Recursive Sequence**
=====================

## Summary
The problem revolves around a recursive sequence where you need to find the next value in the series. The input is given as a starting number and the length of the sequence, and you need to generate the next 'n' terms in the sequence.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use recursion to generate each term in the sequence. We will start with the initial value and then apply a recursive function that generates the next term based on the previous one. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Start with the initial value.
2. Apply a recursive function that takes two parameters: the current term and the remaining length of the sequence.
3. Inside the recursive function, calculate the next term based on the previous one.
4. If the remaining length is 0, return the current term as it's the last term in the sequence.
5. Otherwise, recursively call the function with the new term and decremented length.

Here's a diagram to illustrate the process:

```
         +-----------+
         |  Initial  |
         +-----------+
                  |
                  v
+---------------+      +---------------+
|   Recursive    |      |   Recursive    |
|   Function     |      |   Function     |
+---------------+      +---------------+
                  |                       |
                  |  Calculate next term  |
                  v                       v
+---------------+      +---------------+
|   New Term    |      |   New Term    |
|   (Next in    |      |   (Next in    |
|   sequence)   |      |   sequence)   |
+---------------+      +---------------+
                  |                       |
                  |  Repeat until length|
                  v                       v
         +-----------+
         |  Final term  |
         +-----------+
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the sequence, as we need to generate each term in the sequence. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursive function call stack.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class RecursiveSequence {
    public static int[] generate(int start, int n) {
        int[] result = new int[n];
        result[0] = start;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = calculateNext(result[i-1]);
        }
        return result;
    }

    private static int calculateNext(int previous) {
        // Your logic to calculate the next term based on the previous one
        return previous + 1;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def generate(start, n):
    result = [start]
    for i in range(1, n):
        result.append(calculate_next(result[i-1]))
    return result

def calculate_next(previous):
    # Your logic to calculate the next term based on the previous one
    return previous + 1
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> generate(int start, int n) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    result.push_back(start);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        result.push_back(calculate_next(result[i-1]));
    }
    return result;
}

int calculate_next(int previous) {
    // Your logic to calculate the next term based on the previous one
    return previous + 1;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function generate(start, n) {
    let result = [start];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        result.push(calculate_next(result[i-1]));
    }
    return result;

}

function calculate_next(previous) {
    // Your logic to calculate the next term based on the previous one
    return previous + 1;
}
```
