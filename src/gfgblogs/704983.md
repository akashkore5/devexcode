## Summary
This problem is about finding the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The key concept involved here is mathematical calculation.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2

This formula is derived from the equation of a triangle with `n` sides. Each side represents a term in the sequence and the area of the triangle represents the sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Calculate the value of `n`.
* Use the above formula to calculate the sum.
* Return the calculated sum.

Time complexity: O(1) as we are performing a constant number of operations.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public class SumOfFirstN {
    public static int calculateSum(int n) {
        return n*(n+1)/2;
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def sum_of_first_n(n):
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2
```

#### C++
```cpp
class SumOfFirstN {
public:
    static int calculateSum(int n) {
        return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    }
};
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumOfFirstN(n) {
    return Math.floor((n * (n + 1)) / 2);
}
```
Note: The above code snippets are simple implementations of the formula and do not include any error handling or input validation.
