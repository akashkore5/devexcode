# The Thief Problem

## Summary
In this problem, we are given an array of integers and our task is to find the maximum sum of elements that can be obtained by selecting either all elements in the array or selecting all elements except one. This problem involves basic algorithmic concepts like arrays and loops.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem seems quite simple at first glance, but it requires a good understanding of the given constraints. We are not allowed to skip more than one element from the array, which means we either select all elements or all elements except one. 

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and calculate the sum of all elements. Then, we will subtract each element from the total sum to get the maximum sum that can be obtained by selecting all elements except one. We need to keep track of the maximum sum seen so far.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. Initialize `max_sum` to 0.
2. Calculate the total sum of the array and store it in a variable, say `total_sum`.
3. Iterate through the array, subtracting each element from `total_sum`. Store this new sum in another variable, say `new_sum`.
4. Compare `new_sum` with `max_sum`. If `new_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum`.
5. Finally, return `max_sum`.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the array, as we are doing a single pass through the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static int findMaxSum(int[] arr) {
        int total_sum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            total_sum += num;
        }
        
        int max_sum = total_sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int new_sum = total_sum - arr[i];
            if (new_sum > max_sum) {
                max_sum = new_sum;
            }
        }
        
        return max_sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(findMaxSum(arr));
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_max_sum(arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    
    max_sum = total_sum
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        new_sum = total_sum - arr[i]
        if new_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = new_sum
    
    return max_sum

print(find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int findMaxSum(int arr[], int n) {
    int total_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        total_sum += arr[i];
    }
    
    int max_sum = total_sum;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int new_sum = total_sum - arr[i];
        if (new_sum > max_sum) {
            max_sum = new_sum;
        }
    }
    
    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << findMaxSum(arr, 4);
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findMaxSum(arr) {
    let total_sum = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        total_sum += num;
    }
    
    let max_sum = total_sum;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let new_sum = total_sum - arr[i];
        if (new_sum > max_sum) {
            max_sum = new_sum;
        }
    }
    
    return max_sum;

console.log(findMaxSum([1, 2, 3, 4]));
```
