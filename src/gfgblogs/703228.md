**Minimum steps to get desired array**
=====================================================

## Summary
The problem is about finding the minimum number of operations needed to transform a given array into a target array. The allowed operations are incrementing or decrementing each element by 1. The key concepts involved are arrays, data structures, and algorithms.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. The idea is to maintain a difference array that keeps track of the differences between consecutive elements in both the given and target arrays. We then iterate over the difference array and for each pair of consecutive elements, we calculate the minimum number of operations needed to transform the current element in the given array into the corresponding element in the target array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the minimum number of operations.
2. Calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in both arrays and add them to a new list `diff`.
3. Iterate over `diff` and for each element, calculate the minimum number of operations needed to transform the current element in the given array into the corresponding element in the target array.
4. Add the calculated value to `result`.
5. Return the sum of `result`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating the process:
```
  Given Array: [1, 3, 5]
  Target Array: [2, 4, 6]

  Difference Array: [(1-2), (3-4), (5-6)] = [-1, -1, -1]

  Result: [-1] + [-1] + [-1] = 3
```
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int minSteps(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    int n = arr1.length;
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        result += Math.abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i]) + Math.abs(arr1[i+1] - arr2[i+1]);
    }
    return result;
}
```
### Python
```python
def min_steps(arr1, arr2):
    n = len(arr1)
    result = 0
    for i in range(n-1):
        result += abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i]) + abs(arr1[i+1] - arr2[i+1])
    return result
```
### C++
```cpp
int minSteps(int* arr1, int* arr2, int n) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        result += abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i]) + abs(arr1[i+1] - arr2[i+1]);
    }
    return result;
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function minSteps(arr1, arr2) {
    let n = arr1.length;
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        result += Math.abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i]) + Math.abs(arr1[i+1] - arr2[i+1]);
    }
    return result;
}
```
