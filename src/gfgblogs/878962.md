**Union of Two Sets**
================================

## Summary
The problem "Union of Two Sets" is about combining two sets into a single set containing all unique elements from both sets. This problem involves basic algorithmic concepts, including data structures and mathematical operations.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of union operation in set theory. The union of two sets A and B (denoted by A âˆª B) is a set that contains all elements from both sets, without duplicates. We can achieve this using a hash-based approach or sorting the arrays.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty set or array to store the union.
2. Iterate through the first array and add each element to the set/array if it is not already present.
3. Repeat step 2 for the second array.
4. Return the resulting set/array, which contains all unique elements from both arrays.

Here's a diagram illustrating the process:
```
Array A: [1, 2, 3]
Array B: [2, 4, 5]

Union:
[1] (not present in Array B)
[2] (present in both arrays)
[3] (not present in Array B)
[4] (only present in Array B)
[5] (only present in Array B)

Resulting Union: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both arrays. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store all unique elements.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class UnionOfTwoSets {
    public static int[] union(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : arr1) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        for (int num : arr2) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        int[] result = new int[set.size()];
        int i = 0;
        for (Integer num : set) {
            result[i++] = num;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def union(arr1, arr2):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr1:
        seen.add(num)
    for num in arr2:
        seen.add(num)
    return list(seen)

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [2, 4, 5]
result = union(arr1, arr2)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <set>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> unionSets(const std::vector<int>& arr1, const std::vector<int>& arr2) {
    std::set<int> seen;
    for (int num : arr1) {
        seen.insert(num);
    }
    for (int num : arr2) {
        seen.insert(num);
    }
    std::vector<int> result(seen.begin(), seen.end());
    return result;
}

// Example usage
std::vector<int> arr1 = {1, 2, 3};
std::vector<int> arr2 = {2, 4, 5};
std::vector<int> result = unionSets(arr1, arr2);
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function union(arr1, arr2) {
    const seen = new Set();
    for (const num of arr1) {
        seen.add(num);
    }
    for (const num of arr2) {
        seen.add(num);
    }
    return Array.from(seen);
}

// Example usage
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [2, 4, 5];
const result = union(arr1, arr2);
console.log(result); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
