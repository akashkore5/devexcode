**Rahul Lucky-Unlucky**
=====================

### Summary
This problem is about determining whether a given array is considered "lucky" or "unlucky". A lucky array has at least one pair of adjacent elements that are equal, while an unlucky array does not have any such pairs. This problem involves basic array manipulation and pattern recognition.

### Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the array and checking for adjacent elements that are equal. If such a pair is found, the array is considered lucky; otherwise, it's considered unlucky. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `lucky` to `true`.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each element, check if it is equal to the previous element (if it exists).
4. If such an equal pair is found, set `lucky` to `false`.
5. After iterating through the entire array, return the value of `lucky`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public boolean rahulLucky(int[] arr) {
    boolean lucky = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
            lucky = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    return lucky;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def rahul_lucky(arr):
    lucky = True
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
            lucky = False
            break
    return lucky
```

#### C++
```cpp
bool rahulLucky(int* arr, int n) {
    bool lucky = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
            lucky = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    return lucky;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function rahulLucky(arr) {
    let lucky = true;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === arr[i + 1]) {
            lucky = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    return lucky;
}
```
