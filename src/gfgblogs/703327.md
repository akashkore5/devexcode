# Element with left side smaller and right side greater

## Summary
Given an unsorted array, find the element that has a smaller value on its left side and a greater value on its right side. This problem involves searching for an element in an array while maintaining a balance between left and right sides.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from both ends (left and right). We maintain two pointers, `i` and `j`, initially set to 0 and `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array. 

We compare the values at `i` and `j`. If `arr[i] < arr[j]`, we move the left pointer to the right until we find a pair that satisfies the condition. If not, we move the right pointer to the left.

Once we find such an element, we return it as our answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0 and `n-1`, respectively.
2. Compare `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`. If `arr[i] < arr[j]`, move the left pointer `i` to the right until you find a pair that satisfies the condition.
3. If not, move the right pointer `j` to the left until you find a pair that satisfies the condition.
4. Return the element at index `(i + j) / 2` as our answer.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1).

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public int findElement(int[] arr) {
    int i = 0, j = arr.length - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j--;
        }
    }
    return arr[(i + j) / 2];
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_element(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < j:
        if arr[i] < arr[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    return arr[(i + j) // 2]
```

### C++
```cpp
int findElement(int* arr, int n) {
    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j--;
        }
    }
    return arr[(i + j) / 2];
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findElement(arr) {
    let i = 0, j = arr.length - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j--;
        }
    }
    return arr[Math.floor((i + j) / 2)];
}
```
