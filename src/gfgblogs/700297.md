# Remove every k'th node

## Summary
The problem is to remove every `k`th node from a singly linked list. This involves skipping nodes at intervals of `k`, effectively removing them from the original list. The key concept involved is manipulating a linked list, specifically removing nodes while traversing the list.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we'll create a new pointer that moves one step ahead every `k`th node. As we traverse the original list, we'll keep track of the current node and remove it if it's the `k`th node. We'll also maintain a reference to the previous node to correctly update the next pointer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize three pointers: `curr`, `prev`, and `kth`.
2. Set `kth` to `0` and `curr` to the head of the linked list.
3. Traverse the linked list:
	* If `kth` is equal to `0`, it means we've reached a node that should be removed.
		+ Update `prev` to point to the current node (`curr`).
		+ Move `kth` to `(kth + 1) % k`. This ensures we skip nodes at intervals of `k`.
	* Otherwise, move `curr` one step ahead and update `kth` to `(kth + 1) % k`.
4. Repeat steps 3 until the end of the linked list is reached.
5. Update the next pointer of the last node (`prev`) to point to `NULL`, effectively terminating the list.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables to store the pointers and counters.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class RemoveEveryKthNode {
    public static void removeEveryKthNode(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        int count = 0;

        while (curr != null) {
            if ((count + 1) % k == 0) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.next;
                continue;
            }

            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class RemoveEveryKthNode:
    def remove_every_kth_node(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        count = 0

        while curr:
            if (count + 1) % k == 0:
                prev = curr
                curr = curr.next
                continue

            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
            count += 1

        return prev
```

### C++
```cpp
class RemoveEveryKthNode {
public:
    void removeEveryKthNode(ListNode* head, int k) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        int count = 0;

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            if ((count + 1) % k == 0) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr->next;
                continue;
            }

            prev = curr;
            curr = curr->next;
            count++;
        }
    }
};
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
class RemoveEveryKthNode {
    removeEveryKthNode(head, k) {
        let prev = null;
        let curr = head;
        let count = 0;

        while (curr) {
            if ((count + 1) % k === 0) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.next;
                continue;
            }

            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```
