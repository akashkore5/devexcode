Here is the detailed Markdown blog post for the For Loop - 1 problem:

**For Loop - 1**
===============

## Summary
This problem involves using a for loop to iterate over a range or an array. The goal is to print out specific values or perform some operation on each element.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we will use a for loop in C++ (the given tags are C, Java, and CPP). We will assume that the user wants to print out the numbers from 1 to N.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Start by initializing a variable `i` to 1.
* Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to N (inclusive).
* Inside the loop, print out the value of `i`.
* Increment `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Here is the ASCII art diagram to illustrate the process:

```
      i = 1
      |
      v
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    print(i);
    i++;
  }
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the input size. This is because we are iterating over each element once.

The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the loop variables.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Python
```python
for i in range(1, N+1):
    print(i)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int N;
    std::cin >> N;

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

Note: The above solutions are the most straightforward way to solve this problem. However, it's always good practice to optimize your code for large inputs or memory constraints.
