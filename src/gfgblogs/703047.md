## Summary
The problem "Facing the Sun" is about finding the minimum number of turns required to face the sun from a given direction. The input is an array representing the directions (0 for north, 1 for south, 2 for east, and 3 for west) in which the sun was facing at each minute during the day. The algorithm should return the minimum number of turns required to face the sun.

## Detailed Explanation
The problem can be solved by iterating through the array and calculating the absolute difference between the current direction and the next one. This difference represents the number of turns required to face the sun in that direction. Since the sun always moves in a consistent direction, we only need to consider the minimum number of turns required to reach the first turn where the sun is facing east.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize a variable `turns` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
3. For each direction, calculate the absolute difference between the current direction and the next one.
4. If the difference is greater than or equal to 2, it means we need to turn back to face the sun, so increment `turns` by the difference - 2.
5. Continue iterating until the end of the array.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `turns` variable.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int facingTheSun(int[] directions) {
    int turns = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < directions.length; i++) {
        int diff = Math.abs(directions[i] - directions[i-1]);
        if (diff >= 2) {
            turns += diff - 2;
        }
    }
    return turns;
}
```
### Python
```python
def facing_the_sun(directions):
    turns = 0
    for i in range(1, len(directions)):
        diff = abs(directions[i] - directions[i-1])
        if diff >= 2:
            turns += diff - 2
    return turns
```
### C++
```cpp
int facingTheSun(int* directions, int n) {
    int turns = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int diff = abs(directions[i] - directions[i-1]);
        if (diff >= 2) {
            turns += diff - 2;
        }
    }
    return turns;
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
function facingTheSun(directions) {
    let turns = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < directions.length; i++) {
        const diff = Math.abs(directions[i] - directions[i-1]);
        if (diff >= 2) {
            turns += diff - 2;
        }
    }
    return turns;
}
```
