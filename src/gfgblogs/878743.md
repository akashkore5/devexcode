**Bitwise Operators**
=====================

## Summary
The problem involves using bitwise operators to manipulate binary numbers. The key concept is understanding how bitwise operations work and applying them to solve a specific problem.

## Detailed Explanation
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on each bit of a binary number. They are useful when dealing with binary data or performing bitwise operations in programming.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1.  Initialize two variables `a` and `b` as input integers.
2.  Use bitwise AND (`&`) to find the bits that are set in both `a` and `b`. This operation returns a value where each bit is set if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are set.
3.  Use bitwise OR (`|`) to find the bits that are set in either `a` or `b`. This operation returns a value where each bit is set if the corresponding bits in `a` or `b` are set.
4.  Use bitwise XOR (`^`) to find the bits that are different in `a` and `b`. This operation returns a value where each bit is set if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are different.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) as we're performing constant-time operations. The space complexity is also O(1) as we're not using any extra space.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5; // 00000101
        int b = 3; // 00000011

        System.out.println("Bitwise AND: " + (a & b)); // 00000001
        System.out.println("Bitwise OR: " + (a | b)); // 00000111
        System.out.println("Bitwise XOR: " + (a ^ b)); // 00000110
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def bitwise_operators(a, b):
    print(f"Bitwise AND: {a & b}")
    print(f"Bitwise OR: {a | b}")
    print(f"Bitwise XOR: {a ^ b}")

a = 5 # 00000101
b = 3 # 00000011

bitwise_operators(a, b)
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5; // 00000101
    int b = 3; // 00000011

    cout << "Bitwise AND: " << (a & b) << endl;
    cout << "Bitwise OR: " << (a | b) << endl;
    cout << "Bitwise XOR: " << (a ^ b) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function bitwiseOperators(a, b) {
    console.log(`Bitwise AND: ${a & b}`);
    console.log(`Bitwise OR: ${a | b}`);
    console.log(`Bitwise XOR: ${a ^ b}`);
}

let a = 5; // 00000101
let b = 3; // 00000011

bitwiseOperators(a, b);
```

Note that the above solutions are just examples and may not cover all possible inputs or edge cases.
