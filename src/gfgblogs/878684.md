# Type Conversion

## Summary

The problem of type conversion involves changing the data type of a given value from one format to another. This is a fundamental concept in programming, as it allows us to work with different types of data and perform operations on them. In this problem, we will explore how to convert values between different types in Java.

## Detailed Explanation

The problem of type conversion can be approached in various ways depending on the specific requirements of the program. One common approach is to use casting, which involves explicitly converting a value from one type to another.

Here's an example of how you might convert a double value to an integer:

```java
double d = 3.7;
int i = (int) d; // This will truncate the decimal part and store it in i
```

In this example, we are using a cast `(int)` to explicitly tell Java that we want to treat `d` as an integer.

Another approach is to use methods provided by Java's built-in classes. For instance, you can convert a string to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method:

```java
String s = "123";
int i = Integer.parseInt(s); // This will throw a NumberFormatException if s is not a valid integer
```

In this case, we are relying on Java's built-in parsing logic to convert the string to an integer.

Time and space complexity for these operations depend on the specific conversion being performed. For instance, converting a double to an int has constant time and space complexity (O(1)), while parsing a string to an int can have linear time complexity (O(n)) if the input string is very long.

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double d = 3.7;
        int i = (int) d; // This will truncate the decimal part and store it in i
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def main():
    d = 3.7
    i = int(d) # This will truncate the decimal part and store it in i
    print(i)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double d = 3.7;
    int i = (int)d; // This will truncate the decimal part and store it in i
    cout << i << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function main() {
    var d = 3.7;
    var i = parseInt(d); // This will truncate the decimal part and store it in i
    console.log(i);
}
main();
```
