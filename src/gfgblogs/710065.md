# Unoccupied Computers

## Summary
The problem is about finding all unoccupied computers in a given list. The key concept involved is working with arrays and iterating through them to find specific conditions.

## Detailed Explanation
We are given an array `computers` where each element represents the state of a computer (0 for occupied, 1 for unoccupied). Our goal is to find all the unoccupied computers in this array.

To solve this problem, we will iterate through the array and check each computer's state. If the state is 1 (unoccupied), we add it to our result list.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

* Initialize an empty list `result` to store the unoccupied computers.
* Iterate through the `computers` array using a for loop or any other suitable iteration method.
* For each computer, check its state by accessing the corresponding element in the `computers` array.
* If the state is 1 (unoccupied), add the index of this computer to the `result` list.
* After iterating through all computers, return the `result` list.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of computers.
Space complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result.

## Optimized Solutions
### Java
```java
public int[] findUnoccupiedComputers(int[] computers) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < computers.length; i++) {
        if (computers[i] == 1) {
            result.add(i);
        }
    }
    return result.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
}
```

### Python
```python
def find_unoccupied_computers(computers):
    result = []
    for i, computer in enumerate(computers):
        if computer == 1:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> findUnoccupiedComputers(int computers[], int n) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (computers[i] == 1) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function findUnoccupiedComputers(computers) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < computers.length; i++) {
        if (computers[i] === 1) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
