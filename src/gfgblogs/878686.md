# TypeCast And Double It

## Summary
The problem "TypeCast And Double It" involves taking an integer as input and performing two operations on it: typecasting it to a double and then doubling its value. The goal is to write efficient algorithms in different programming languages (Java, Python, C++, JavaScript) that achieve this.

## Detailed Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to first understand the basic concept of typecasting in programming. Typecasting involves converting an object of one data type into another data type. In this case, we are converting an integer to a double, which is a common operation in programming.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Take an integer as input from the user.
2. Typecast the integer to a double using the respective language's syntax (e.g., `double` in Java or Python, `double()` in C++).
3. Double the value of the double by multiplying it with 2.

The time complexity for this problem is O(1), as we are performing constant-time operations like typecasting and multiplication.

The space complexity is also O(1), as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

Here's an ASCII art diagram to illustrate the process:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Integer Input  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  v
+-----------------------+
|  Typecast to Double    |
+-----------------------+
                  |
                  v
+-----------------------+
|  Double and Return     |

```

## Optimized Solutions

### Java
```java
public class TypeCastAndDouble {
    public static double typeCastAndDouble(int num) {
        return (double) num * 2;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def type_cast_and_double(num):
    return float(num) * 2
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

double typeCastAndDouble(int num) {
    return static_cast<double>(num) * 2.0;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    std::cout << "Typecast and doubled: " << typeCastAndDouble(num) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
function typeCastAndDouble(num) {
    return Number(num) * 2;
}

console.log(typeCastAndDouble(5)); // Output: 10.0
```
