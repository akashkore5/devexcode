### Summary
Given a sorted array of integers, find the last duplicate element. The input array is already sorted in ascending order.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the current element and its previous occurrence. If we encounter an element that matches the current one, we update the previous occurrence and continue the iteration until we find a new element or reach the end of the array.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize two variables: `prev` to store the previous element and `last_duplicate` to store the last duplicate element.
2. Iterate through the array:
	* For each element, check if it matches the current one (`curr`) or its previous occurrence (`prev`).
	* If it's a match, update `prev` with the current element and set `last_duplicate` to the current element.
	* If it's not a match, reset `prev` to the current element.
3. Return `last_duplicate`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra memory.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int lastDuplicate(int[] arr) {
    int prev = -1;
    int last_duplicate = -1;
    for (int curr : arr) {
        if (curr == prev) {
            last_duplicate = curr;
        }
        prev = curr;
    }
    return last_duplicate;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def last_duplicate(arr):
    prev = -1
    last_duplicate = -1
    for curr in arr:
        if curr == prev:
            last_duplicate = curr
        prev = curr
    return last_duplicate
```

#### C++
```cpp
int lastDuplicate(int arr[], int n) {
    int prev = -1;
    int last_duplicate = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == prev) {
            last_duplicate = arr[i];
        }
        prev = arr[i];
    }
    return last_duplicate;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function lastDuplicate(arr) {
    let prev = -1;
    let last_duplicate = -1;
    for (let curr of arr) {
        if (curr === prev) {
            last_duplicate = curr;
        }
        prev = curr;
    }
    return last_duplicate;
}
```
