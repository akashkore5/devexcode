### Summary
This problem involves counting the number of occurrences of a specific target element in an unsorted array. The key concepts involved are arrays and data structures.

### Detailed Explanation

Given an unsorted integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, write a function to count the number of times `k` appears in the array. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will store the frequency of `k`.
2. Iterate through each element `x` in the array.
3. If `x` is equal to `k`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. Return the final value of `count`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we need to traverse the entire array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int countNumber(int[] arr, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int x : arr) {
        if (x == k) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def count_number(arr, k):
    count = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x == k:
            count += 1
    return count
```

#### C++
```cpp
int countNumber(int* arr, int n, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == k) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function countNumber(arr, k) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let x of arr) {
        if (x === k) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
