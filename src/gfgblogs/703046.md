### Summary

Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, each representing a number in base 10, find the sum of these numbers. The input arrays are guaranteed to be valid representations of non-negative integers.

The key concepts involved in this problem are arrays and data structures.

### Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we can convert the two arrays into integers and then add them together. We can use a simple loop to iterate over the arrays, multiplying each digit by its corresponding power of 10 (since we're working with base 10) and adding it to our running total.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an integer `result` to 0.
2. Iterate over the lengths of both input arrays using a for loop. Let's call these lengths `n1` and `n2`.
3. For each iteration, multiply the current digit of `arr1` by 10^(n2-1) (since we're subtracting one from n2 because array indices start at 0).
4. Add this product to `result`.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for `arr2`, multiplying each digit by 10^(n1-1).
6. Return the sum of `result` and the result of adding `arr1[0]` and `arr2[0]`.

Here's an ASCII art diagram illustrating this process:
```
    arr1: [1, 2, 3]
    arr2: [4, 5]

    Initialize result = 0
    Iterate over lengths:
      n1 = 3, n2 = 2
      Multiply current digit of arr1 by 10^(n2-1) = 10^1 = 10
      Add product to result = 0 + 10 = 10
      Repeat for arr2: multiply each digit by 10^(n1-1) = 10^2 = 100
      Add products to result = 10 + 100 = 110

    Return sum of result and first digits: 110 + (1+4) = 115
```
The time complexity for this solution is O(n1+n2), where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the input arrays. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra memory.

### Optimized Solutions

#### Java
```java
public int sumOfArrays(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = Math.max(arr1.length - 1, arr2.length - 1); i >= 0; i--) {
        result += (arr1[i] + arr2[i]) * (int)Math.pow(10, i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def sum_of_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    result = 0
    for i in range(max(len(arr1) - 1, len(arr2) - 1), -1, -1):
        result += (arr1[i] + arr2[i]) * (10 ** i)
    return result
```

#### C++
```cpp
int sumOfArrays(int* arr1, int* arr2, int n1, int n2) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = max(n1 - 1, n2 - 1); i >= 0; i--) {
        result += (arr1[i] + arr2[i]) * pow(10, i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
function sumOfArrays(arr1, arr2) {
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = Math.max(arr1.length - 1, arr2.length - 1); i >= 0; i--) {
        result += (arr1[i] + arr2[i]) * Math.pow(10, i);
    }
    return result;
}
```
