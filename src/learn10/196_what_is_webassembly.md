**What is WebAssembly?**
WebAssembly, Wasm, WASM - the new kid on the block that's causing a stir in the developer community.

As developers, we're no strangers to the world of JavaScript. It's been our trusted companion for building dynamic, interactive web applications for years. However, there are times when we wish we could use other languages like C++ or Rust for building certain parts of our application. That's where WebAssembly (Wasm) comes in - a new binary format that allows us to compile and run code written in multiple programming languages in modern web browsers.

So, what is WebAssembly? In simple terms, Wasm is an intermediate representation (IR) of code that can be compiled from various source languages like C, C++, Rust, and even JavaScript. This IR is then executed by a runtime environment within the browser or other host platforms. Think of it as a new instruction set architecture (ISA) for the web.

The key benefits of Wasm are:

* **Portability**: Code written in any language can be compiled to Wasm and run in any platform that supports Wasm, including modern browsers.
* **Efficiency**: Wasm code is executed directly by the runtime environment without the need for an interpreter or just-in-time (JIT) compilation, making it faster than traditional JavaScript execution.
* **Memory Safety**: Wasm provides a memory-safe environment, which eliminates common issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers.

Now that we've covered the basics of Wasm, let's take a look at how it works:

```plain
  +---------------+
  |   Source Code  |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
  +---------------+
  |  Compiler/    |
  |  Transpiler   |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
  +---------------+
  |      Wasm IR     |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
  +---------------+
  |  Runtime Environment|
  +---------------+
           |
           |
  +---------------+
  |  Host Platform/  |
  |  Browser         |
  +---------------+
```

In this diagram, we have our source code written in a language of choice. This code is then compiled or transpiled into Wasm IR using a compiler or transpiler like wasm-pack. The Wasm IR is executed by the runtime environment within the host platform or browser.

In conclusion, WebAssembly is a game-changer for web development. It allows us to write high-performance code in languages other than JavaScript and execute it directly in the browser. This opens up new possibilities for building complex web applications that require the benefits of native code execution.

**TL;DR**: WebAssembly (Wasm) is an intermediate representation of code that can be compiled from various source languages like C, C++, Rust, or even JavaScript. It provides portability, efficiency, and memory safety, making it a powerful tool for building complex web applications.
