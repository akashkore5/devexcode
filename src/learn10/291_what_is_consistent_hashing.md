Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to distribute data across multiple nodes while minimizing the number of node changes when the system scales or shrinks. In this blog post, we'll dive into what consistent hashing is, how it works, and its applications.

**Intro**
When building distributed systems, one of the biggest challenges is ensuring that data is evenly distributed across multiple nodes. This becomes even more critical when you're dealing with large datasets or real-time updates. Consistent hashing provides a solution to this problem by assigning each piece of data to a specific node in such a way that the assignment remains relatively stable as the system scales.

**Main Content**
Consistent hashing uses a combination of hash functions and modulo arithmetic to assign data to nodes. The process can be broken down into three main steps:

1. **Hashing**: Each piece of data is hashed using a hash function, resulting in a unique identifier (UID). This UID is used as the primary key for the data.
2. **Modulo operation**: The UID is then passed through a modulo operation with the total number of nodes in the system. This reduces the UID to a value within the range of node indices.
3. **Node assignment**: The resulting node index is used to determine which node in the system should store the data.

Here's an example of how this works:

| Data UID | Hash Function Output | Modulo (4 nodes) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12345 | 3451 | 1 |
| 67890 | 9012 | 3 |
| 11111 | 2111 | 0 |

In this example, the data with UIDs 12345 and 11111 would be assigned to node 0, while the data with UID 67890 would be assigned to node 3.

**Benefits**
Consistent hashing provides several benefits, including:

* **Scalability**: When a new node is added or an existing one removed, only a small number of UIDs need to be reassigned.
* **Fault tolerance**: If a node fails, its contents can be quickly rehashed and redistributed among the remaining nodes.
* **Balanced load**: Consistent hashing ensures that each node carries roughly the same amount of data, reducing the load on individual nodes.

**TL;DR**
Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to distribute data across multiple nodes while minimizing the number of node changes when the system scales or shrinks. It uses hash functions and modulo arithmetic to assign data to nodes, providing benefits such as scalability, fault tolerance, and balanced load.
