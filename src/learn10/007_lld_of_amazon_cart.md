**Intro**

As the world moves towards more complex and distributed systems, ensuring the reliability and scalability of your applications becomes a significant challenge. One such approach is Load Balancing, which helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple nodes to ensure no single point of failure. In this post, we'll explore the concept of Last-Loaded Node (LLD) in the context of Amazon Cart, a popular load balancing technique for distributed systems.

When designing scalable and reliable distributed systems, it's essential to balance incoming traffic across multiple nodes. This is where LLD comes into play. LLD stands for Last-Loaded Node, which refers to the node that was most recently loaded with requests.

Here's a simple example of how LLD works in Amazon Cart:

* Imagine you have three EC2 instances (A, B, and C) running your application.
* Each instance receives an equal number of incoming requests initially.
* As more requests come in, one of the instances (let's say A) starts to receive more traffic than others.
* When this happens, Amazon Cart considers A as the "Last-Loaded Node" and sends subsequent requests to B or C instead.

This technique helps in several ways:

* **Scalability**: By sending new requests to nodes that are less loaded, you're effectively distributing incoming traffic more evenly, ensuring your system can handle a larger number of requests.
* **Reliability**: In case one node fails or becomes unavailable, LLD ensures that other nodes are still receiving requests, minimizing the impact on overall system performance.

**Benefits**

By using LLD in Amazon Cart, you gain:

* Improved scalability: Distribute incoming traffic more efficiently and handle a larger number of requests.
* Enhanced reliability: Minimize the impact of node failures or unavailability by sending requests to other nodes.

**TL;DR**

In this 10-minute guide, we explored the concept of Last-Loaded Node (LLD) in Amazon Cart, a popular load balancing technique for distributed systems. LLD ensures that your system can handle a larger number of requests and minimizes the impact of node failures or unavailability. By distributing incoming traffic more efficiently, you'll achieve improved scalability and reliability in your distributed applications.
