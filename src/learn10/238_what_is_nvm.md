**Intro:**
As a developer, you might have encountered the term "nvm" in your JavaScript journey. If you're new to this acronym or still unclear about its purpose, don't worry - we've got you covered! In this 10-minute read, we'll dive into what nvm is and how it simplifies managing different Node.js versions.

**Blog Body:**
Node Version Manager (nvm) is a command-line tool designed to help developers manage multiple versions of Node.js on their system. With the rise of JavaScript's popularity, the need for efficient version management has become crucial. Imagine working on projects that require different Node.js versions - switching between them manually would be tedious and error-prone.

Before nvm, you had to:

* Manually download and install each version
* Configure environment variables and PATHs accordingly
* Keep track of installed packages with npm

nvm simplifies this process by allowing you to easily install, switch, and manage different Node.js versions on your system. Here's how it works:

1. **Install nvm**: Start by installing nvm using a package manager like npm or yarn: `npm install -g nvm` (or `yarn global add nvm`)
2. **List available versions**: Run `nvm ls` to see the list of installed Node.js versions
3. **Install a new version**: Use `nvm install <version>` to download and install a specific version (e.g., `nvm install v14.17.0`)
4. **Switch between versions**: Activate a specific version using `nvm use <version>` (e.g., `nvm use v16.13.1`)

Here's an ASCII diagram to illustrate the process:

```
         +---------------+
         |  nvm ls   |
         +---------------+
                  |
                  |  List available versions
                  v
         +---------------+
         |  nvm install |
         +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Install new version (e.g., v14.17.0)
                  v
         +---------------+
         |  nvm use    |
         +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Switch to installed version (e.g., v16.13.1)
```

**TL;DR:** In a nutshell, nvm is a powerful tool that helps you manage multiple Node.js versions on your system. With its simple commands and intuitive interface, you can easily install, switch between, and keep track of different Node.js versions. Give it a try and streamline your development workflow!
