**Intro**

When you visit a website starting with `https://`, your browser and the website's server engage in a crucial process called the HTTPS handshake. This process ensures that your data remains confidential and tamper-proof during transmission. But what happens behind the scenes? In this 10-minute read, we'll dive into the world of SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to understand how the HTTPS handshake keeps your online interactions secure.

The HTTPS handshake is a negotiation process between your browser and the website's server that takes place every time you visit an HTTPS-protected site. The goal is to establish a trusted connection, verifying each party's identity and ensuring that the communication remains encrypted.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Client Hello**: Your browser initiates the handshake by sending a `Client Hello` message to the server, which includes:
	* A random session ID (to prevent replay attacks)
	* Supported SSL/TLS versions
	* Cipher suite preferences (e.g., AES-256-CBC or ChaCha20-Poly1305)
2. **Server Hello**: The server responds with a `Server Hello` message, containing:
	* Its own supported SSL/TLS version(s)
	* A chosen cipher suite (based on your browser's preferences)
	* A random session ID (to match the one sent by your browser)
3. **Certificate**: The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate, which includes:
	* The server's identity (domain name and/or organization information)
	* Public key
	* Digital signature (generated using a private key)
4. **Verify Certificate**: Your browser verifies the server's certificate by checking:
	* Whether it was issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
	* Whether the certificate is valid for the server's domain name
5. **Pre-Master Secret**: Your browser generates a random `Pre-Master Secret` and sends it to the server, which also generates its own.
6. **Master Secret**: The client and server use their respective Pre-Master Secrets to generate a shared `Master Secret`. This is done using a key agreement protocol like Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).
7. **Encrypted Communication**: Both parties use the Master Secret to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communication, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the data.

                  | (1) Client Hello
                  v

          |  Server     |
          +---------------+

                  | (2) Server Hello

                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Pre-Master Secret |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (4) Master Secret
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Encrypted Communication |
          +---------------+
```

**TL;DR**

In summary, the HTTPS handshake is a crucial process that establishes a secure connection between your browser and an HTTPS-protected website. It involves:

* Client and server exchanging random session IDs and supported SSL/TLS versions
* Server sending its certificate for verification
* Generating a shared Master Secret using Pre-Master Secrets
* Encrypting communication using the Master Secret

This handshake ensures that your online interactions remain confidential, tamper-proof, and protected from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
