**Intro**
When it comes to storing and querying large amounts of data, two popular options are binary search trees (BSTs) and B+ trees. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different use cases. In this post, we'll dive into the world of data structures and explore the key differences between BSTs and B+ trees.

A binary search tree is a type of data structure that allows you to efficiently search for elements in a sorted array. It's called "binary" because each node has at most two children, making it suitable for recursive algorithms. A BST typically consists of nodes with a key-value pair and pointers to left and right child nodes.

On the other hand, a B+ tree is a self-balancing data structure that keeps its nodes approximately half-full. This property makes it ideal for storing and retrieving large amounts of data in a database or file system. A B+ tree consists of root node, leaf nodes, and internal nodes.

**Key differences:**

* **Balancing**: BSTs don't need to balance themselves, while B+ trees are self-balancing.
* **Node structure**: BST nodes typically store only the key-value pair, whereas B+ tree nodes may contain additional metadata like child pointers or node sizes.
* **Leaf node structure**: In a BST, leaf nodes can be any type of data, whereas in a B+ tree, leaf nodes typically contain the actual data and are organized as a contiguous array.

Here's a simple ASCII diagram to illustrate the difference:

```
        +---------------+
        |  Root Node   |
        +---------------+
               |
               v
    +-----------------------+
    |     Internal Node      |
    +-----------------------+
            |
            v
    +-----------------------+
    | Leaf Node (key-value)  |
    +-----------------------+

        +---------------+
        |  Root Node   |
        +---------------+
               |
               v
    +----------------------------+
    |  B+ Tree Node (key, child)  |
    +----------------------------+
            |
            v
    +----------------------------+
    | Leaf Node (contiguous array)|
    +----------------------------+
```

**TL;DR**
When it comes to storing and querying large amounts of data, both binary search trees (BSTs) and B+ trees have their strengths. While BSTs are suitable for smaller datasets with simple queries, B+ trees are better suited for large-scale databases or file systems where self-balancing is crucial.

In conclusion, understanding the differences between BSTs and B+ trees can help you make informed decisions when designing your next data-intensive project.
