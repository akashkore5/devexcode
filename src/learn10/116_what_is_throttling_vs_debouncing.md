**Intro**
When working with events in JavaScript, you may have come across terms like "throttling" and "debouncing". While they're often used interchangeably, they serve distinct purposes. In this post, we'll dive into the world of event handling and explore what throttling and debouncing are, how they differ, and when to use each.

**Blog Body**

Events in JavaScript provide a way to respond to user interactions, such as clicks or form submissions. However, when dealing with multiple events in quick succession (e.g., rapid typing in an input field), the number of event handlers can become overwhelming. This is where throttling and debouncing come into play.

### Throttling

Throttling limits the frequency at which a function is called within a certain time frame. Imagine you're building a search functionality that updates results as the user types. Without throttling, your server would receive multiple requests in rapid succession, causing performance issues. By introducing a throttle, you can ensure that only one request is sent every X milliseconds.

Here's an example of a simple throttle using JavaScript:
```javascript
function throttle(fn, time) {
  let timeout = null;

  return function(...args) {
    if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }, time);
  };
}
```
### Debouncing

Debouncing, on the other hand, ensures that a function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed since the last event. Think of it as introducing a delay before executing an action. In our previous search example, debouncing would mean waiting until the user stops typing for a short period (e.g., 500ms) before sending the request to your server.

Here's an example of a simple debouncer:
```javascript
function debounce(fn, time) {
  let timeout = null;

  return function(...args) {
    if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }, time);
  };
}
```
Notice that both throttling and debouncing use a timeout to control the frequency of function calls. The key difference lies in their purpose:

* Throttling is about rate limiting (controlling how often something happens).
* Debouncing is about delaying until no further events occur for a certain period.

### When to Use Each

When deciding between throttling and debouncing, consider the following scenarios:

* **Use throttling** when you want to limit the frequency of function calls based on some time interval. Examples include:
	+ Rate limiting API requests to prevent abuse.
	+ Limiting the number of form submissions within a short period.
* **Use debouncing** when you want to delay executing an action until no further events occur for a certain time frame. Examples include:
	+ Implementing a "type-to-search" functionality with a short delay before sending the request.
	+ Waiting until a user stops typing for a moment before processing their input.

In summary, throttling controls how often something happens, while debouncing delays until no further events occur.

### TL;DR
Throttling and debouncing are two essential techniques in JavaScript event handling. Throttling limits the frequency of function calls within a time frame, whereas debouncing introduces a delay before executing an action. By understanding the differences between these concepts, you'll be better equipped to optimize your code for improved performance and user experience.
