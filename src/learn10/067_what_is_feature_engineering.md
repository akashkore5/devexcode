**Intro**
When it comes to building a machine learning model, we often focus on the algorithm itself, thinking that the more complex and sophisticated our model is, the better it will perform. However, in reality, the success of your model relies heavily on the quality and relevance of the input features you provide. This is where feature engineering comes in – the process of selecting, transforming, and combining existing features to create new ones that are more informative and relevant for your problem at hand.

Feature engineering is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline that involves manipulating and transforming raw data into features that are better suited for your model. This process can involve a wide range of techniques, including:

* **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing/scaleing data, removing duplicates or outliers
* **Dimensionality reduction**: Reducing the number of features in your dataset to improve computational efficiency and prevent overfitting
* **Data transformation**: Converting categorical variables into numerical ones, aggregating data from multiple sources

The goal of feature engineering is to create a set of features that are:

* **Informative**: Provide additional information about the target variable
* **Relevant**: Directly or indirectly relate to the problem you're trying to solve
* **Non-redundant**: Don't contain duplicate information

Some common techniques used in feature engineering include:

* **One-hot encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical ones by creating binary vectors for each category
* **Label encoding**: Assigning a unique label to each category, with the goal of preserving the original ordering
* **Imputation**: Filling missing values using mean, median, or regression imputation
