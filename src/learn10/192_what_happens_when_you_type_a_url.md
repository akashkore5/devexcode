**Intro**
Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type a URL into your web browser? From the moment you hit Enter to the instant the website loads in front of you, there are several crucial steps that take place. In this post, we'll dive into the process and explore how your computer and the internet work together to bring you the content you desire.

When you type a URL into your browser's address bar, the journey begins! Here's what happens:

1. **Typing**: You enter the URL into the address bar, which is usually in the form of `http://www.example.com`. The browser remembers any previously entered URLs for quick access.
2. **Parsing**: The browser breaks down the URL into its components:
	* Protocol (e.g., http or https)
	* Domain name (e.g., www.example.com)
	* Path (e.g., /path/to/page)
3. **DNS Resolution**: The browser sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to resolve the domain name. This process involves:
	+ Looking up the IP address associated with the domain name
	+ Verifying the authenticity of the response using Digital Certificates (optional)
4. **TCP Handshake**: Once the DNS resolution is complete, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake to establish a connection with the server.
5. **HTTP Request**: The browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server, including:
	+ Method (e.g., GET or POST)
	+ Request headers (e.g., User-Agent, Accept-Language)
	+ Request body (for POST requests)

Here's a simplified ASCII diagram illustrating the process:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Browser    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Parse URL
                  |  DNS Resolution
                  |  TCP Handshake
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Network    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  HTTP Request
                  |  Server Response
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Server     |
          +---------------+
```
**TL;DR**
When you type a URL into your browser, the process involves:

1. Parsing the URL
2. DNS resolution to find the server's IP address
3. Establishing a TCP connection with the server
4. Sending an HTTP request to retrieve the desired content

The journey may seem complex, but it's all part of what makes the internet work!
