### Intro

In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), representing text data effectively is crucial for various applications like language modeling, sentiment analysis, and text classification. One popular approach to text representation is using word embeddings, which map words or phrases into dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, as the size of the vocabulary grows, computing these representations becomes computationally expensive. This is where the embedding chunking strategy comes in â€“ a clever technique for reducing computational costs while maintaining representation quality.

The embedding chunking strategy involves dividing the input text into smaller chunks or segments, rather than processing the entire text at once. This approach takes advantage of the fact that most texts have a hierarchical structure, with some parts being more important than others. By focusing on smaller chunks, we can reduce the computational cost and memory requirements associated with computing word embeddings.

The basic idea is to divide the input text into overlapping segments, often referred to as "chunks." Each chunk is then processed separately to generate its corresponding embedding representation. This strategy allows us to:

* **Reduce memory usage**: By processing smaller chunks, we require less memory to store the intermediate results.
* **Improve computational efficiency**: Computing embeddings for smaller chunks is generally faster than processing the entire text.
* **Preserve local context**: Chunking helps maintain the local context and relationships within each segment.

Here's a simple illustration of the embedding chunking strategy:

```
Text: This is an example sentence
Chunks:
- "This" + "is"
- "is" + "an"
- "an" + "example"
- ...
```

In this example, we divide the input text into overlapping chunks, such as "This" + "is," "is" + "an," and so on. Each chunk is then processed separately to generate its embedding representation.

### TL;DR

The embedding chunking strategy is a clever technique for reducing computational costs while maintaining the quality of word embeddings. By dividing input text into smaller chunks, we can reduce memory usage, improve computational efficiency, and preserve local context. This approach is particularly useful when working with large texts or limited resources.
