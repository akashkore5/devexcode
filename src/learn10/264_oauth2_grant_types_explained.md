**Intro:**
OAuth2 is a widely-used protocol for authorization and authentication between systems. As developers, we've all had to implement OAuth2 at some point or another. But have you ever stopped to think about the different ways that OAuth2 can be used? In this post, we'll explore the various grant types that make up the OAuth2 protocol, what they're used for, and when to use them.

OAuth2 provides four main grant types: Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner Password Credentials, and Client Credentials. Let's dive into each of these:

### 1. Authorization Code Grant

The Authorization Code grant is the most commonly used grant type in OAuth2. This flow is designed for client-side applications that have access to a user's browser. The flow goes like this:
- The client (your app) redirects the user to the authorization server (e.g., Google or GitHub) with an authorization request.
- The user grants consent, and the authorization server generates an authorization code.
- The client receives the authorization code and exchanges it for an access token.

Use cases: This grant type is perfect for web applications that need to access a user's data on their behalf. Examples include single sign-on (SSO) integrations or third-party APIs that require authentication.

### 2. Implicit Grant

The Implicit grant is similar to the Authorization Code grant but doesn't involve an authorization code exchange. Instead, the client directly receives an access token:
- The client redirects the user to the authorization server with an authorization request.
- The user grants consent, and the authorization server generates an access token.
- The client receives the access token.

Use cases: This grant type is suitable for JavaScript-based applications (e.g., single-page apps) that don't have direct access to a browser. Examples include mobile or desktop applications that need to access a user's data on their behalf.

### 3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The Resource Owner Password Credentials grant is designed for scenarios where the client has already obtained the end-user's credentials (e.g., username and password). This flow goes like this:
- The client receives the user's credentials.
- The client sends a request to the authorization server with the user's credentials.
- The authorization server verifies the credentials and generates an access token.

Use cases: This grant type is perfect for scenarios where you already have direct access to a user's credentials, such as when integrating with an existing login system. Examples include native mobile or desktop applications that need to access a user's data on their behalf.

### 4. Client Credentials Grant

The Client Credentials grant is designed for client-side applications that don't require user interaction. This flow goes like this:
- The client sends a request to the authorization server with its own credentials.
- The authorization server verifies the client's credentials and generates an access token.

Use cases: This grant type is suitable for scenarios where you're integrating your API with another API or service, without requiring user interaction. Examples include automated workflows, data synchronization, or reporting tools that need to access a specific API on behalf of itself.

**TL;DR:** OAuth2 provides four main grant types for authorization and authentication: Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner Password Credentials, and Client Credentials. Each grant type has its own use cases and flow. By understanding these differences, you'll be better equipped to choose the right grant type for your specific project requirements.
