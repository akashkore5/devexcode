**HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3: What's the Difference?**
`http, https, networking, protocol, http2, http3`

As developers, we're constantly working with protocols that enable communication between clients and servers. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is one such protocol that has undergone significant changes over the years. In this post, we'll explore the differences between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, two major updates to the original HTTP protocol.

**Intro**

HTTP/1.1 has been the foundation of web communication for decades, but it has its limitations. With the rise of modern web applications and increasing demands on network resources, a new version was needed. Enter HTTP/2 (2015) and HTTP/3 (2020). Both updates aimed to improve performance, security, and efficiency. In this blog post, we'll delve into the key differences between these two protocols.

**HTTP/2: The First Step Towards Multiplexing**

Released in 2015, HTTP/2 is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, HTTP/1.1. Its primary focus was to improve performance by introducing multiplexing and header compression. Here are some key features:

* **Multiplexing**: Allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.
* **Header Compression**: Uses HPACK (header compression) to reduce the size of HTTP headers, resulting in faster transmission times.

**HTTP/3: The Next Step Towards Efficiency**

Released in 2020, HTTP/3 is built on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which provides better performance and reliability. It also includes some significant changes:

* **Use of UDP**: Instead of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) like HTTP/2, HTTP/3 uses UDP for improved performance.
* **Stream Prioritization**: Allows prioritizing individual streams within a connection, ensuring critical requests are served first.
* **Improved Error Handling**: Provides better error handling and reduced latency.

**What's the Difference?**

Here's a summary of the key differences between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:

| Feature | HTTP/2 | HTTP/3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multiplexing | Yes | No (uses UDP) |
| Header Compression | Yes | No (uses QUIC) |
| Connection Establishment | TCP/IP | UDP |
| Stream Prioritization | No | Yes |
| Error Handling | Improved | Further Improved |

**TL;DR**

In summary, HTTP/2 focuses on multiplexing and header compression to improve performance, while HTTP/3 builds upon those features with the addition of stream prioritization, improved error handling, and a move to UDP for better performance. As developers, understanding these differences will help you make informed decisions about which protocol to use in your projects.
