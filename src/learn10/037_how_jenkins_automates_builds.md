**Intro**
As a developer, you know how tedious and time-consuming manual builds can be. Building, testing, and deploying code manually can be a real pain, especially when working on large projects or collaborating with teams. That's where Jenkins comes in - an open-source automation server that simplifies the process of automating builds, tests, and deployments. In this 10-minute guide, we'll explore how Jenkins automates builds and makes your development workflow more efficient.

Jenkins is a powerful tool for automating builds, tests, and deployments. Here's how it works:

1. **Configure Your Project**: First, you need to set up your project in Jenkins. You can do this by creating a new job or importing an existing one.
2. **Choose Your Build Script**: Next, you'll need to select the build script language (e.g., Ant, Maven, Gradle) and specify the commands to run during the build process.
3. **Define Your Build Steps**: In Jenkins, you can define multiple build steps, such as:
	* **Build**: Run your chosen build script to compile and package your code.
	* **Test**: Run automated tests (e.g., JUnit, PyUnit) to verify your code works as expected.
	* **Deploy**: Deploy your built artifact to a target environment (e.g., production, staging).
4. **Configure Your Build Triggers**: Jenkins allows you to set up triggers for when builds should run. Common options include:
	* **Polling**: Run builds at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).
	* **Webhook**: Trigger builds via incoming webhooks from other tools or services.
5. **Monitor and Manage Your Builds**: Once your build is configured, you can monitor its status in the Jenkins UI. You can also manage your builds by stopping, pausing, or resuming them as needed.

Here's a simple ASCII diagram to illustrate the process:

**TL;DR**
In this post, we explored how Jenkins automates builds by configuring projects, choosing build scripts, defining build steps, and setting up triggers. With Jenkins, you can streamline your development workflow, reduce manual errors, and improve collaboration among team members.
