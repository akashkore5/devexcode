**Intro**

As developers, we've all been there - staring at a seemingly simple piece of code, wondering why it's not working as expected. Debugging can be a frustrating and time-consuming process, especially when dealing with complex frontend applications like our beloved Todo App. In this post, we'll take a deep dive into the Low-Level Design (LLD) of the Todo App's frontend, focusing on common issues that might arise during development. By breaking down the components and interactions, we'll create a solid foundation for debugging and troubleshooting.

Let's start with the basic architecture of our Todo App:

```markdown
          +---------------+
          |  Redux Store  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Dispatch
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  React Components  |       |  Action Creators  |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Props
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  UI Elements    |       |  State Management  |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

Here, we have a Redux Store managing the state of our app. It's connected to React components through dispatch and props. Action Creators handle user interactions, updating the store accordingly.

Now, let's explore some common issues that might arise:

* **Component re-renders excessively**: This could be due to an incorrect implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate()` or a missing memoization. In such cases, you can try logging the component's props and state changes to identify the root cause.
* **Incorrect state updates**: Verify that your Action Creators are correctly updating the Redux Store. Use tools like React DevTools or Chrome's Debugger to inspect the component's state and store values.
* **UI inconsistencies**: Check for potential rendering issues by verifying that all components are properly rendered, including those inside conditional statements (e.g., `if` statements).
* **Performance bottlenecks**: Identify slow-performing components using profiling tools like React DevTools or Chrome's Performance Tab. Optimize your code by reducing the number of re-renders, improving DOM manipulation, or optimizing computationally expensive operations.

To further streamline debugging, consider implementing the following best practices:

* Use consistent naming conventions and structure for your components, actions, and reducers.
* Organize your code into logical sections, making it easier to locate specific pieces of code.
* Utilize React's built-in logging mechanisms (e.g., `console.log()`) or a dedicated debugging library like `debug` to inspect component props and state.

**TL;DR**

Debugging the frontend of our Todo App requires a deep understanding of its architecture, components, and interactions. By applying best practices, such as implementing consistent naming conventions, organizing code logically, and utilizing React's built-in logging mechanisms, you'll be well-equipped to tackle common issues like excessive component re-renders, incorrect state updates, UI inconsistencies, and performance bottlenecks.
