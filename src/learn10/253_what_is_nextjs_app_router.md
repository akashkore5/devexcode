As developers, we're always looking for ways to build faster, more scalable, and more maintainable web applications. One tool that has gained popularity in recent years is Next.js App Router. But what exactly is it? In this post, we'll dive into the world of server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side routing with React, and explore how Next.js App Router can simplify your development process.

**What is Next.js App Router?**

Next.js App Router is a built-in feature of Next.js that allows you to create a router for your application. It's designed to work seamlessly with React, and provides an intuitive way to manage client-side routing. In traditional React applications, routing is typically handled by a third-party library like React Router. However, Next.js App Router takes it a step further by integrating server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities.

**How does it work?**

Here's a high-level overview of how Next.js App Router works:

* When a user visits your application, the request is routed to the server.
* The server-side rendering process generates HTML for the requested route.
* The generated HTML is then sent back to the client, where it's rendered in the browser.
* Once the HTML is rendered, the client-side router takes over and handles subsequent routing requests.

**Benefits of using Next.js App Router**

So, why should you consider using Next.js App Router? Here are a few benefits:

* **Server-Side Rendering**: By rendering pages on the server, you can improve SEO and provide faster page loads.
* **Improved Security**: Since the HTML is generated on the server, you don't have to worry about exposing sensitive data in your JavaScript code.
* **Simplified Routing**: With Next.js App Router, you can define routes using a simple API, without having to write custom routing logic.

**Getting started with Next.js App Router**

Ready to give it a try? Here's a basic example of how to set up Next.js App Router:

```jsx
import { createApp } from 'next/app';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{router.pathname}</h1>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default createApp(MyApp);
```

**TL;DR**

In this post, we explored the concept of Next.js App Router and its benefits. We saw how it integrates server-side rendering with client-side routing, providing a simplified way to manage routes in your React application. By using Next.js App Router, you can improve SEO, security, and performance, making it an attractive option for building modern web applications.
