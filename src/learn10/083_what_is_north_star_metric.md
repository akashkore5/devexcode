**Intro**

In the world of business and product development, setting goals and measuring progress are crucial for success. One popular framework used to achieve this is Objective Key Results (OKRs). Within OKRs, a North Star Metric plays a vital role in defining what matters most for your organization or product. In this post, we'll dive into what a North Star Metric is, its importance, and how you can apply it to drive business success.

A North Star Metric is the key performance indicator (KPI) that best measures progress toward achieving your company's or product's most important objectives. It serves as a guiding light, helping teams stay focused on what truly matters. In other words, a North Star Metric provides direction and clarity on what you want to achieve.

To illustrate this concept, consider the following diagram:

```
          +---------------+
          |  Business Goals  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (OKRs)
                  v
+-----------------------+       +-----------------------+
|  North Star Metric    |       |  Key Performance     |
|  (KPI)                |       |  Indicator (KPI)      |
+-----------------------+       +-----------------------+
```

Here, the Business Goals serve as the foundation for setting OKRs. The North Star Metric is then derived from these goals and used to measure progress.

Why is a North Star Metric important? Having one helps you:

* **Stay focused**: By aligning your team around a single metric, you ensure everyone is working toward the same objective.
* **Measure what matters**: A North Star Metric helps you identify what truly drives business success, rather than getting lost in a sea of metrics.
* **Make informed decisions**: With a clear understanding of your North Star Metric, you can make data-driven choices about where to invest time and resources.

To illustrate how this works, let's consider an example:

Suppose we're building a mobile shopping app, and our Business Goal is to increase revenue. Our OKR might be: "Increase revenue by 20% within the next quarter." To measure progress toward this goal, we define our North Star Metric as "Average Order Value (AOV)" â€“ the total value of items purchased per order.

By focusing on AOV, we can gauge how well our app is performing and make adjustments to optimize sales. This could involve tweaking the user interface, improving search functionality, or offering personalized recommendations.

**TL;DR**

In summary, a North Star Metric is a key performance indicator that serves as a guiding light for your organization or product. It's derived from Business Goals and OKRs, providing direction on what truly matters. By having a clear North Star Metric, you'll stay focused, measure what matters, and make informed decisions to drive business success.
