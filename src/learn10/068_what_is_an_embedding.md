**Intro**
In the world of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), embeddings are a crucial concept that has revolutionized the way we analyze text data. But what exactly are they? In this 10-minute read, we'll dive into the basics of embeddings and explore how they've become an essential tool in modern NLP.

An embedding is a mathematical representation of a piece of text, such as a word or phrase, as a numerical vector in a high-dimensional space. This vector is designed to capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing us to perform various tasks like text classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.

To understand how embeddings work, let's consider an example. Imagine you have a set of words that are related to food: "pizza", "sandwich", "salad", etc. A traditional approach would be to represent each word as a one-hot vector (a binary vector where all elements are 0 except for one element which is 1). However, this approach has some limitations.

One-hot vectors don't capture the semantic meaning of words and can lead to sparse and unhelpful representations. For instance, "pizza" and "sandwich" might be represented as two completely different vectors, even though they share similar characteristics (e.g., being types of food).

Embeddings solve this problem by learning a continuous representation space where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points in the vector space. This is achieved through an optimization process that minimizes the difference between the target word and its context words.

One popular technique for creating embeddings is Word2vec, which uses two primary architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-Gram predicts the context given a target word.

Word2vec has been widely adopted in various NLP applications, such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization. More recently, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has become an industry standard for creating high-quality embeddings.

**TL;DR**
In summary, an embedding is a numerical representation of text data that captures its semantic meaning. This concept has revolutionized the field of NLP by enabling tasks like text classification and recommendation systems. Word2vec and BERT are two popular techniques for creating high-quality embeddings that have been widely adopted in various applications.
