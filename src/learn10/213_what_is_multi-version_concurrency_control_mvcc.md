**Intro**
When it comes to building high-performance and scalable database applications, ensuring data consistency and integrity in a concurrent environment is crucial. This is where Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) comes into play. In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of MVCC, exploring its concept, benefits, and how it differs from other concurrency control methods.

Imagine a scenario where multiple transactions are executing concurrently, modifying the same data in a database. Without proper concurrency control, these transactions might interfere with each other, leading to inconsistent or lost data. This is where MVCC steps in.

MVCC is a technique used by databases to manage concurrent access to shared resources (data). The core idea is to create multiple versions of the same data and keep track of them as different "snapshots" of the database's state at a particular point in time. When a transaction wants to modify some data, the database creates a new version of that data and keeps the old one intact.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Transaction isolation**: Each transaction operates on its own snapshot of the database, ensuring that each transaction sees the world as it was when it started.
2.  **Versioning**: When a transaction wants to modify some data, the database creates a new version of that data and keeps the old one intact.
3.  **Conflict resolution**: If multiple transactions want to modify the same data, the database resolves the conflict by choosing the "winning" version based on factors like timestamp or priority.

By using MVCC, databases can ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, even when modifying the same data. This approach provides several benefits:

*   **Improved concurrency**: Multiple transactions can modify different parts of the database without interfering with each other.
*   **Reduced locking**: Transactions only lock specific rows or pages, rather than entire tables, reducing contention and improving overall performance.
*   **Enhanced fault tolerance**: If a transaction fails or is rolled back, the database can simply discard its changes and return to the previous state.

**TL;DR**
In summary, MVCC is a technique used by databases to manage concurrent access to shared resources (data). By creating multiple versions of the same data and keeping track of them as different "snapshots" of the database's state, MVCC ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other. This approach provides improved concurrency, reduced locking, and enhanced fault tolerance, making it an essential feature in modern databases.
