**How Does HTTPS Work?**
=====================

`https`, `ssl`, `tls`, `security`

When you browse the internet, you trust that your personal information and sensitive data are protected from prying eyes. This is where **HTTPS** comes in – a vital layer of security that ensures the integrity of online transactions. But how exactly does it work? In this article, we'll dive into the world of HTTPS and explore its underlying technologies.

### What's the Problem with HTTP?

Before we dive into the solution, let's understand the issue at hand. **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an essential protocol for transferring data over the internet. However, it's a plaintext protocol – meaning that all communications between your browser and the server are transmitted in plain text. This poses significant security risks:

* Eavesdropping: Hackers can intercept your requests and responses.
* Tampering: Data can be modified or injected with malicious code.
* Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: Attackers can pretend to be both you and the server, making it seem like a legitimate connection.

To mitigate these risks, we need a way to encrypt and verify the identity of the communicating parties. This is where **HTTPS** comes in – an extension of HTTP that adds an extra layer of security using **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols.

### How HTTPS Works

Here's a high-level overview of how HTTPS works:

1. **Certificate Authority**: When a website wants to enable HTTPS, it obtains a digital certificate from a trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)** like VeriSign or GlobalSign. This certificate includes the website's identity and public key.
2. **Client-Server Handshake**: When you visit an HTTPS-enabled site, your browser establishes a connection with the server. The client (your browser) initiates the process by sending a **Client Hello** message to the server.
3. **Certificate Presentation**: The server responds with its digital certificate, which includes its identity and public key. This is called the **Server Hello** response.
4. **Key Exchange**: Your browser uses the received certificate to establish a secure connection using the **RSA** (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) or **ECDSA** (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) key exchange algorithm.
5. **Symmetric Encryption**: Both parties agree on a shared secret key, which is used for symmetric encryption. This ensures that all subsequent communication remains encrypted and tamper-proof.

Here's an ASCII diagram illustrating the process:

                  |
                  |  Client Hello
                  v
      +---------------+
      |  Server     |
      +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Server Hello (Certificate)
                  v
      +---------------+
      |  Client    |
      +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Key Exchange
                  v
      +---------------+
      |  Server     |
      +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Shared Secret Key
                  v
      +---------------+
      |  Symmetric  |
      |  Encryption  |
      +---------------+
```
### TL;DR

In this article, we explored the basics of HTTPS and how it works. To recap:

* HTTP is a plaintext protocol that poses security risks.
* SSL/TLS protocols (like RSA or ECDSA) provide encryption and identity verification.
* The client-server handshake involves certificate presentation and key exchange.
* Symmetric encryption ensures secure communication.

By understanding how HTTPS works, you'll be better equipped to protect your online transactions and keep the internet a safer place.
