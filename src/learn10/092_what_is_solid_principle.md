**Intro**
As developers, we strive to write high-quality code that is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by following well-established design principles. SOLID (Single responsibility principle, Open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, Interface segregation principle, Dependency inversion principle) is a set of five principles aimed at making our code more robust, flexible, and easier to extend.

The SOLID principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin in his book "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices". Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software development, helping developers create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient code.

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should have only one responsibility or single purpose. This means that instead of having a class that handles multiple tasks, you should break down your application into smaller classes each with its own specific task.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you can add new functionality to an existing class without modifying it. This is achieved by using interfaces and abstract classes, allowing you to create new implementations without affecting the original code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP states that subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. In other words, if a class B inherits from class A, then any code that uses instances of class A should work correctly with instances of class B.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. In other words, instead of having a large interface that multiple classes implement, you should break down your interfaces into smaller ones that each class implements.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but both should depend on abstractions. In other words, instead of having high-level classes depending on low-level classes, you should have them both depend on the same abstraction or interface.

**TL;DR**
SOLID principles are a set of five design patterns aimed at making our code more maintainable, scalable, and efficient. By following these principles, we can create robust, flexible, and easy-to-extend code that is less prone to errors and easier to understand.
