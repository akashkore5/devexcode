### Intro

As developers, we strive to build secure and reliable applications that protect user data and prevent potential threats. In this fast-paced digital world, it's crucial to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to identifying and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 is a widely-adopted guide that helps us prioritize security efforts by highlighting the most critical web application risks.

### Main Content

The OWASP Top 10 is an annual list of the top 10 most common web application security risks, ranked according to their severity and potential impact. The project's goal is to educate developers, architects, and security professionals about the most critical vulnerabilities affecting web applications. This ranking serves as a valuable reference for prioritizing security efforts and ensuring that organizations can effectively manage risk.

The OWASP Top 10 list has undergone several updates since its inception in 2003. Each iteration reflects changing threat landscapes, new attack vectors, and evolving security best practices. The current (2021) list consists of the following top 10 web application vulnerabilities:

1. **A01:2017 - Broken Access Control**: Lack of proper access controls allows unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform unintended actions.
2. **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**: Weak, outdated, or misconfigured cryptographic algorithms put sensitive information at risk.
3. **A03:2021 - Injection**: Unvalidated user input leads to SQL injection, command injection, or other types of code injection attacks.
4. **A04:2021 - Insecure Design**: Flawed design choices lead to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
5. **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**: Inadequate configuration of web servers, databases, and other components exposes applications to potential threats.
6. **A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Using outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries, frameworks, or plugins can compromise application security.
7. **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures**: Inadequate authentication mechanisms or weak passwords allow unauthorized access.
8. **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Insufficient validation of user input or inadequate error handling leads to data corruption or tampering.
9. **A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Inadequate logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.
10. **A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Malicious users can manipulate server-side requests, leading to unintended consequences.

### TL;DR

The OWASP Top 10 is an annual list of the most critical web application vulnerabilities, designed to help developers and security professionals prioritize security efforts. By understanding these common risks, you can take steps to protect your applications from potential threats and improve overall web application security.
