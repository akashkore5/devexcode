**Intro**

As developers, we're always on the lookout for efficient ways to manage our codebases and collaborate with team members. One popular approach gaining traction is Trunk-Based Development (TBD). In this post, we'll delve into what TBD is, its benefits, and how it can streamline your development workflow.

Trunk-Based Development is a software development methodology that involves storing all changes in the main trunk of your version control system. This approach was popularized by GitFlow, which introduced the concept of long-lived feature branches and short-lived release branches. However, TBD takes this idea further by encouraging developers to integrate their changes into the main trunk as soon as possible.

Here's a high-level overview of how TBD works:

1. **Create a new branch**: When starting work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the latest main trunk commit.
2. **Develop and test**: Work on your feature or bug fix in isolation, making commits to your local branch as needed.
3. **Integrate with trunk**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, merge your branch into the main trunk.
4. **Release**: After integrating your changes, create a new release branch for any changes that are ready for production.

**Benefits of Trunk-Based Development**

So, what's the big deal about storing all changes in the main trunk? Here are some benefits:

* **Reduced merge hell**: By integrating changes early and often, you'll reduce the risk of merge conflicts and tedious merge resolutions.
* **Improved collaboration**: With everyone working on the same trunk, it's easier to collaborate and share knowledge across the team.
* **Faster feedback**: Since all changes are integrated into the main trunk, you'll get faster feedback from your CI/CD pipeline and colleagues.
* **Less branch overhead**: You won't need to maintain a multitude of feature branches or release branches, which can simplify your workflow.

**TBD in Practice**

Here's an example of how TBD might look in practice using Git:

```
git flow init
git checkout -b feature/new-login-system
// Make changes and commit...
git push origin feature/new-login-system

// Later, integrate the change into trunk
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-login-system
git push origin main

// Release the new login system
git checkout -b release/1.2
git merge main
git push origin release/1.2
```

**TL;DR**

Trunk-Based Development is a software development methodology that involves storing all changes in the main trunk of your version control system. By integrating changes early and often, you'll reduce merge hell, improve collaboration, and get faster feedback. With fewer branches to manage, your workflow will become more streamlined and efficient.
