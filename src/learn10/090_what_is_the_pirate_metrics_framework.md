The Pirate Metrics framework was popularized by Dave McClure in his 2007 presentation "How to Make Money in Your Sleep." It's a simple, one-page model that breaks down the user acquisition process into five key stages:

### Acquisition (A)

* This is the stage where you attract new users to your product or service. Common metrics include:
	+ Total users acquired
	+ Cost per acquisition (CPA)
	+ Conversion rate

### Activation (R)

* At this stage, you're trying to get new users to start using your product or service. Key metrics include:
	+ Onboarding rate
	+ Time-to-first-activation (e.g., making a purchase or completing a task)
	+ Activation rate

### Retention (R)

* Now that you have activated users, it's essential to keep them engaged and retained. Important metrics are:
	+ Daily/weekly/monthly active users
	+ Retention rate (percentage of users who come back after a certain period)
	+ Average session length

### Referral (R)

* Word-of-mouth marketing is powerful! This stage focuses on encouraging happy customers to refer others to your product or service. Key metrics include:
	+ Net promoter score (NPS)
	+ Customer referral rate
	+ Advocacy rate

### Revenue (R)

* The final stage is where you measure the actual revenue generated from your user base. Important metrics are:
	+ Average revenue per user (ARPU)
	+ Total revenue generated
	+ Conversion rate (percentage of users who make a purchase or complete a desired action)

**TL;DR:**
The Pirate Metrics framework is a simple, one-page model that breaks down the user acquisition process into five stages: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue. By tracking key metrics in each stage, you'll gain insights to optimize your growth strategy, improve user engagement, and drive revenue.
