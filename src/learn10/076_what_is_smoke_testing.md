**Intro:**
When it comes to ensuring the quality of a software application, there are various testing strategies that can be employed. One such strategy is smoke testing, which has gained popularity in recent years due to its effectiveness in early defect detection and prevention. In this blog post, we will delve into what smoke testing is, how it differs from other types of testing, and when to use it.

**Main Blog Content:**

Smoke testing, also known as integration testing or sanity testing, is a software testing technique that involves testing the most critical parts of an application to ensure they are functioning as expected. The goal of smoke testing is not to test every aspect of the application but rather to identify any major issues that would prevent the system from working correctly.

Here's how it works: during the development process, the development team writes a set of test cases that cover the most critical features and functionality of the application. These test cases are then executed manually or using automated testing tools. If any defects are found, they are reported to the development team, which then fixes them before moving forward with further testing.

**What sets smoke testing apart:**

Smoke testing is different from other types of testing in that it focuses on the high-level functionality of the application rather than individual components. This approach allows testers to identify any major issues early on, preventing downstream problems that can be costly and time-consuming to fix. Here are some key characteristics of smoke testing:

• **Focus:** Smoke testing focuses on the most critical parts of the application, such as user interface, data processing, and system integration.
• **Goals:** The primary goal is to identify any major issues that would prevent the system from working correctly.
• **Coverage:** Smoke testing typically covers a small percentage of the total functionality but tests key scenarios that are likely to fail.

**When to use smoke testing:**

Smoke testing is particularly useful in the following situations:

• **During development:** Smoke testing can be used during the development process to ensure that the application is working correctly and identify any major issues early on.
• **After changes:** When changes are made to an existing application, smoke testing can be used to verify that the changes have not introduced new defects.
• **Before deployment:** Before deploying a new version of the application, smoke testing can be used to ensure that it is working correctly and identify any potential issues.

**TL;DR:**
In summary, smoke testing is a software testing technique that involves testing the most critical parts of an application to ensure they are functioning as expected. It's a quick and effective way to identify any major issues early on, preventing downstream problems that can be costly and time-consuming to fix. By focusing on high-level functionality rather than individual components, smoke testing provides valuable insights into the overall health of the application, making it an essential tool in any software development process.
