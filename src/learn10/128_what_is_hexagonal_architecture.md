### Intro
In the world of software development, designing an application's architecture can be a daunting task. With so many different approaches and frameworks to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. One popular design pattern that has gained traction in recent years is Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters). In this post, we'll dive into what Hexagonal Architecture is, how it works, and the benefits of using this approach.

Hexagonal Architecture was first introduced by Alistair Cockburn in 2005. The idea behind this pattern is to separate the application's business logic from its infrastructure concerns (like databases, file systems, networks, etc.). This separation allows for a more modular and flexible design that can adapt to changing requirements.

At its core, Hexagonal Architecture consists of two main components:

* **Domain Layer**: This layer contains the application's business logic, which is the heart of the system. It defines the problem domain and the rules that govern it.
* **Infrastructure Layer**: This layer is responsible for interacting with external systems, such as databases, file systems, networks, etc.

To connect these two layers, Hexagonal Architecture introduces the concept of **Ports** and **Adapters**:

* **Ports**: These are interfaces that define how the Domain Layer interacts with the outside world. They represent the "contract" between the application's business logic and its infrastructure.
* **Adapters**: These are concrete implementations of the Ports that connect to specific infrastructure components (like databases, file systems, networks, etc.).

Here's an ASCII diagram to illustrate this:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Domain Layer  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|   Port: Database  |       |  Adapter: DB   |
|  (interface)      |       |  (concrete impl.)|
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Adapter: File  |       |  Port: Network  |
|  (concrete impl.)|       |  (interface)     |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```
In this example, the Domain Layer has two ports: one for database interactions and another for network communications. The Adapters are concrete implementations of these Ports that connect to specific infrastructure components.

### TL;DR
Hexagonal Architecture is a design pattern that separates an application's business logic from its infrastructure concerns by introducing Ports (interfaces) and Adapters (concrete implementations). This approach allows for a more modular, flexible, and maintainable design that can adapt to changing requirements. By keeping the Domain Layer independent of specific infrastructure components, developers can easily switch between different databases, file systems, or networks without affecting the application's core logic.
