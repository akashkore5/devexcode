**Intro**

In today's digital age, password security is crucial for protecting your users' sensitive information. Storing passwords securely requires a combination of robust algorithms, proper encryption, and careful handling. In this blog post, we'll dive into the fundamentals of secure password storage, highlighting best practices and pitfalls to avoid.

When storing passwords, it's essential to consider two primary concerns:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensure that only authorized parties can access and decrypt stored passwords.
2. **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modifications or tampering with the stored data.

To achieve these goals, you'll need a solid understanding of cryptographic techniques. Here are some key concepts:

* **Hashing**: A one-way function that transforms input data into a fixed-length string (hash). This is useful for storing passwords because it's computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original password from the hash.
* **Salting**: Adding a unique value (salt) to the input data before hashing. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack hashed passwords.
* **Stretching**: Repeating the hashing process multiple times, making it computationally expensive for attackers to perform brute-force attacks.

**Storing Passwords Securely**

Now that we've covered the basics, let's discuss how to store passwords securely:

1. **Use a strong hashing algorithm**: Choose an algorithm with high computational complexity and resistance to collisions, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt.
2. **Salt and stretch your hash**: Add a unique salt value and perform multiple iterations of the hashing process to slow down attackers.
3. **Store the salt and hashed password separately**: Keep the salt and hashed password in different columns or tables to prevent attackers from using the salt to generate alternative hashes.

**Example Java Code (Bcrypt)**

Here's an example of how you might implement Bcrypt password storage in Java:
```java
import org.mindrot.jbcrypt.BCrypt;

public class PasswordStorage {
    public static String hashPassword(String password) {
        return BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());
    }

    public static boolean verifyPassword(String storedHash, String inputPassword) {
        return BCrypt.checkpw(inputPassword, storedHash);
    }
}
```
**TL;DR**

Securely storing passwords requires a combination of robust algorithms, proper encryption, and careful handling. To protect your users' secrets:

* Use a strong hashing algorithm like Argon2 or PBKDF2
* Salt and stretch your hash to slow down attackers
* Store the salt and hashed password separately

By following these best practices, you'll ensure that your application provides robust password storage and keeps your users' sensitive information safe.
