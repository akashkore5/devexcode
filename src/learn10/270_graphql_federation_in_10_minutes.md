As the complexity of applications grows, so does the need for a scalable and maintainable architecture. One way to achieve this is by using microservices, which allow you to break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. But how do you connect these services together? That's where GraphQL Federation comes in.

**Intro**

GraphQL Federation is a relatively new concept that allows multiple GraphQL servers to be combined into a single federated schema. This enables you to query data across different microservices without having to worry about the underlying complexity of connecting them. In this post, we'll explore what GraphQL Federation is, how it works, and why it's an essential tool for building scalable and maintainable applications.

So, what is GraphQL Federation?

GraphQL Federation is a standard that allows multiple GraphQL servers to be combined into a single federated schema. This is achieved through the use of "federations," which are essentially configurations that define how different GraphQL schemas can be combined.

Here's an example of how it works:

Suppose you have two microservices: one for handling user data and another for handling order data. Each service has its own GraphQL schema, but they need to be connected so that users can query their orders.

To achieve this, you would create a federation configuration that defines how the two schemas should be combined. This might involve mapping specific queries or types from one schema to the other, or defining how data from both schemas should be resolved when queried together.

Here's an example of what a federation configuration might look like:
```yaml
federation:
  services:
    - name: user-service
      url: https://user-service.com/graphql
      queryType: UserQuery
    - name: order-service
      url: https://order-service.com/graphql
      queryType: OrderQuery

resolvers:
  - type: User
    service: user-service
  - type: Order
    service: order-service
```
In this example, the federation configuration defines two services: `user-service` and `order-service`. Each service has its own GraphQL schema, which is accessed through a specific URL. The configuration also defines resolvers for each type (User and Order), which specify which service should be used to resolve queries for that type.

When a client sends a query to the federated schema, the federation layer will route the query to the correct service based on the resolver configurations. This allows the client to access data from both services without having to worry about the underlying complexity of connecting them.

**Why GraphQL Federation is Important**

GraphQL Federation is an essential tool for building scalable and maintainable applications because it enables you to:

* Connect multiple microservices together seamlessly
* Query data across different services without having to write custom code or APIs
* Define a single, unified schema that can be used by clients

This makes it easier to build and maintain complex applications, as well as integrate new services into your architecture.

**TL;DR**

GraphQL Federation is a standard that allows multiple GraphQL servers to be combined into a single federated schema. This enables you to query data across different microservices without having to worry about the underlying complexity of connecting them. By defining resolvers and configuring how different schemas should be combined, you can build scalable and maintainable applications that are easier to integrate and maintain.

**Conclusion**

In this post, we've explored what GraphQL Federation is, how it works, and why it's an essential tool for building scalable and maintainable applications. With GraphQL Federation, you can connect multiple microservices together seamlessly and query data across different services without having to write custom code or APIs. Whether you're building a new application or integrating existing services into your architecture, GraphQL Federation is definitely worth considering.
