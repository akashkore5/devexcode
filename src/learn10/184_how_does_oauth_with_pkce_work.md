**Intro:**
When it comes to securing your web applications, you need a reliable way to authenticate users and authorize access to resources. One popular solution is the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which provides an open standard for authorization. In this post, we'll dive into how OAuth with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) works, a crucial component of modern authentication.

**Main Blog Content:**

OAuth is based on the concept of client-server architecture, where the client (usually a web or mobile app) requests access to resources from a server. The server verifies the client's identity and grants access if authorized. To ensure secure communication, OAuth uses tokens, such as Bearer Tokens, which contain the necessary information for authentication.

However, traditional OAuth flows have some limitations. One major issue is the threat of phishing attacks, where an attacker steals the authorization code and uses it to gain unauthorized access. This is where PKCE comes in â€“ a mechanism designed to prevent this kind of attack.

Here's how it works:

1. **Client Registration**: The client registers with the authorization server (AS) and obtains a `client_id` and `client_secret`.
2. **Authentication Request**: The client initiates an authentication request, including its `client_id`, desired scope, and a random value called the "code verifier" (`cv`). This is sent to the AS.
3. **Authorization Code**: The AS responds with an authorization code (`ac`) and challenges the client to prove it has possession of the original `cv`. To do this, the client generates a hash of the `cv` using a specific salt value (called the "code challenge") and sends it back to the AS.
4. **Verification**: The AS verifies that the received hash matches its own calculation using the same `cv`, `salt`, and hashing algorithm. If successful, the AS issues an access token (`at`) with the requested scope.

**PKCE in Action:**

Here's a simplified example of how PKCE works:
```
// Client-side
client_id = "your_client_id";
cv = generateRandomCodeVerifier();
code_challenge = hash(cv, salt);
request = {
  client_id,
  scope: ["read", "write"],
  code_verifier: cv,
  code_challenge: code_challenge
};

// Server-side (AS)
received_code_challenge = request.code_challenge;
cv = verifyCodeChallenge(received_code_challenge, salt);
if (cv matches original_code_verifier) {
  // Issue access token with requested scope
  at = generateAccessToken(request.scope);
} else {
  // Return error: invalid code challenge
}
```
**TL;DR:**
OAuth with PKCE is a secure way to authenticate users and authorize access to resources. It prevents phishing attacks by requiring the client to prove possession of the original authorization code verifier. The AS verifies this using a shared salt value and hashing algorithm, ensuring that only authorized clients can obtain an access token.

**Note:** This explanation simplifies the PKCE flow for clarity purposes. In practice, you should follow the official OAuth 2.0 specification and implement additional security measures to protect your application.
