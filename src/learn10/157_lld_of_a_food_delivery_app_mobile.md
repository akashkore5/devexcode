**Intro:**
With the rise of online food ordering and delivery, building a successful food delivery app is crucial for any restaurant or food establishment. In this blog post, we'll delve into the Low-Level Design (LLD) of a mobile food delivery app, exploring its architectural layers and discussing how Android architecture components can be leveraged to create a scalable and maintainable application.

**Blog Body:**
A food delivery app typically involves multiple features such as user authentication, menu browsing, ordering, payment processing, and order tracking. To design an efficient and modular system, we'll break down the app into distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI):** This layer is responsible for rendering the UI components, handling user interactions, and managing data binding. In Android, this can be achieved using the Android Architecture Components library, specifically the `ViewModel` class.

Here's a simplified example of how you might use a `ViewModel` to handle data retrieval:
```java
public class MenuViewModel extends ViewModel {
    private MutableLiveData<List<MenuItem>> menuItems;

    public MenuViewModel() {
        menuItems = LiveDataReactiveStreams.fromPublisher(
                Observable.just(getMenuItemsFromDatabase())
                        .map(items -> items.stream()
                                .filter(MenuItem::isAvailable)
                                .collect(Collectors.toList()))
        );
    }

    public LiveData<List<MenuItem>> getMenuItems() {
        return menuItems;
    }
}
```
2. **Business Logic Layer (BL):** This layer contains the core logic of the app, including business rules and data processing. You can use Java or Kotlin classes to implement this layer.

For example, you might have a `OrderProcessor` class that handles order creation, updating, and cancellation:
```java
public class OrderProcessor {
    public void createOrder(Order order) {
        // Validate order details
        // Save order to database
    }

    public void updateOrder(Order order) {
        // Update order status in the database
    }

    public void cancelOrder(Order order) {
        // Cancel order and notify customer
    }
}
```
3. **Data Access Layer (DAL):** This layer is responsible for managing data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. You can use SQLite databases or cloud-based services like Firebase Firestore.

For instance, you might have a `MenuItemDAO` class that handles menu item CRUD operations:
```java
public class MenuItemDAO {
    private SQLiteOpenHelper db;

    public List<MenuItem> getAllMenuItems() {
        // Query the database for all menu items
    }

    public void saveMenuItem(MenuItem item) {
        // Insert or update the menu item in the database
    }
}
```
4. **Network Layer:** This layer handles network requests and responses, such as API calls to integrate with third-party services.

For example, you might have a `PaymentProcessor` class that interacts with a payment gateway:
```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(Payment payment) {
        // Make API call to the payment gateway
    }
}
```
**TL;DR:**
In this blog post, we explored the Low-Level Design (LLD) of a mobile food delivery app, focusing on its architectural layers and how Android architecture components can be leveraged to create a scalable and maintainable application. We discussed the presentation layer using `ViewModel`, business logic layer with Java or Kotlin classes, data access layer using SQLite databases or cloud-based services, and network layer handling API calls and responses.
