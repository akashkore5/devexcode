**What is tmux?**
==================

tmux, terminal multiplexer (tmm) (terminal, multiplexer), session management (session, management)

When it comes to managing multiple terminal sessions on a remote server or your local machine, you may find yourself constantly opening and closing tabs in your terminal. But what if you could have multiple terminals open at the same time, each with its own session, without having to switch between them every time? That's where tmux comes in - a powerful tool that allows you to create, manage, and detach terminal sessions like a pro.

**What is tmux?**

tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is a command-line utility that enables multiple virtual terminals within a single physical terminal. It allows you to have multiple shell sessions running simultaneously without the need for multiple shells or tabs. This makes it an essential tool for developers, system administrators, and anyone who needs to manage multiple terminal sessions regularly.

**How does tmux work?**

tmux creates a new session when you start it, which is essentially a virtual container for your terminal. You can then split this session into multiple panes or windows, each with its own shell prompt. This allows you to have multiple tasks running at the same time without having to constantly switch between them.

Here's an example of how tmux works:

```
          +---------------+
          |  Session    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Split
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Pane 1     |       |  Pane 2     |
|  (shell)   |       |  (shell)   |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

**Advantages of tmux**

tmux has several advantages that make it an essential tool for anyone who works in the terminal:

* **Multiple sessions**: You can have multiple shell sessions running at the same time, making it easy to manage multiple tasks and projects.
* **Session management**: tmux allows you to detach from a session and reattach later, so you can leave your terminal open all day without worrying about losing your work.
* **Panes and windows**: You can split your terminal into multiple panes or windows, each with its own shell prompt, making it easy to have multiple tasks running at the same time.
* **Persistent sessions**: tmux sessions are persistent, meaning that they will remain open even if you disconnect from the server or restart your computer.

**Getting started with tmux**

If you're new to tmux, here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. Install tmux: You can install tmux on most Linux distributions using the package manager.
2. Start tmux: Run `tmux` in your terminal to start a new session.
3. Split the session: Use the `Ctrl+b` shortcut to split the session into multiple panes or windows.
4. Detach from the session: Use the `Ctrl+d` shortcut to detach from the session and leave it running in the background.

**TL;DR**

tmux is a powerful tool that allows you to create, manage, and detach terminal sessions like a pro. It enables multiple virtual terminals within a single physical terminal, making it an essential tool for developers, system administrators, and anyone who needs to manage multiple terminal sessions regularly. With tmux, you can have multiple shell sessions running at the same time without having to constantly switch between them.
