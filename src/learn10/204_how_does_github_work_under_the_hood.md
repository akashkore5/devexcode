**SEO Keywords:** GitHub, version control, Git, repositories, servers, architecture

**Intro:**
GitHub has become an essential tool for developers and teams working on open-source projects or collaborative software development. With over 100 million users and counting, it's no surprise that many are curious about what makes GitHub tick under the hood. In this post, we'll dive into the architecture of GitHub and explore how it manages to handle millions of repositories and countless code changes daily.

**Main Blog Content:**

At its core, GitHub is a version control system built on top of Git (a decentralized version control system). Here's a high-level overview of the components that make up GitHub's architecture:

### 1. Frontend
The frontend is the user-facing interface where developers can interact with their repositories, issue tracking, and other features. This is what you see when logging in to your GitHub account.

### 2. Backend
The backend handles all the heavy lifting for storing, processing, and serving data. It's written in Ruby on Rails and leverages PostgreSQL as its database.

### 3. Git Servers (Gitosis)
To ensure scalability and performance, GitHub uses multiple git servers (Gitosis) to store and manage repositories. These servers are distributed across multiple data centers worldwide, making it possible to access your repositories from anywhere.

### 4. Load Balancers
Load balancers sit in front of the backend servers, ensuring that incoming requests are efficiently routed and distributed among available servers.

### 5. Database (PostgreSQL)
The PostgreSQL database stores all metadata related to users, repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.

Here's a simplified ASCII diagram illustrating GitHub's architecture:

```
          +---------------+
          |  Frontend    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | API
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Load Balancers |       | Backend Servers|
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |   |
                  |   | Database (PostgreSQL)
                  v   v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Gitosis (Git    |       |  Multiple Data Centers 
Servers)      |       |  Worldwide
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

### TL;DR:**
In summary, GitHub's architecture is built around a scalable and distributed system that leverages multiple components to manage repositories, user data, and requests. The frontend provides an intuitive interface for developers, while the backend handles storage, processing, and serving of data. With load balancers, Gitosis (git servers), and a robust database setup, GitHub can efficiently handle millions of users and repository updates daily.
