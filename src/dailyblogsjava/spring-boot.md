	+ For beginners: Imagine having a personal assistant who takes care of all the setup for you!
	+ Advanced: Auto-configuration allows for easy customization and can be used to create custom configurations for specific environments.
* **MVC Framework**: Spring Boot provides an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework that simplifies building web applications. This includes routing, request handling, and view rendering.
	+ For beginners: Think of it like a recipe book – follow the steps, and you'll have a delicious application!
	+ Advanced: The MVC framework can be customized for specific use cases, such as creating RESTful APIs or handling file uploads.

### Practical Examples
Here are some Java code examples to demonstrate Spring Boot in action:

#### Example 1: Embedded Server
```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
For beginners: This code sets up a simple Spring Boot application with an embedded server. When you run this application, it will start the server and allow you to access your application.

#### Example 2: Auto-Configuration
```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return new DriverManagerDataSource("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "username", "password");
    }
}
```
For beginners: This code demonstrates auto-configuration by setting up a database connection. Spring Boot will automatically configure the database settings for you.

#### Example 3: MVC Framework
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String homePage(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "home";
    }
}
```
For beginners: This code sets up a simple MVC framework that handles HTTP requests and renders a view. In this case, it returns an HTML page with the message "Hello, World!".

### Common Use Cases
Spring Boot is commonly used in various scenarios, including:
* **Building RESTful APIs**: Spring Boot simplifies the creation of RESTful services that can handle HTTP requests and responses.
