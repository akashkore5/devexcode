# OOP Design Problems

## Introduction

As a Java developer, designing systems using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles is crucial for building robust and maintainable applications. Whether you're working on a large-scale enterprise project or creating a simple tool to manage your personal tasks, understanding how to apply OOP concepts effectively can make all the difference. In this article, we'll explore some common design problems that require creative solutions using OOP principles.

For beginners, think of designing an object-oriented system like building with LEGOs. You start with individual bricks (classes) and then combine them in various ways to create a structure (system). Each brick has its own characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods), which interact with each other to form the final product. As you get more comfortable, you'll learn how to create complex structures by combining multiple bricks in innovative ways.

For advanced developers, designing systems using OOP principles is essential for creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. In industries like finance or healthcare, where data security and integrity are paramount, OOP design can help ensure that your software meets the highest standards.

## Prerequisites

To fully understand this topic, you should have:

* Basic knowledge of Java programming language
* Familiarity with OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition
* Understanding of design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory) and principles (e.g., SOLID)

Beginners can brush up on these topics by exploring online resources like Oracle's Java Tutorials or introductory programming books.

## Key Concepts

Here are three core concepts that will help you tackle OOP design problems:

* **Parking Lot System**: Imagine designing a system to manage parking spots in a busy city. You need to keep track of available and occupied spaces, as well as handle requests for reservations and cancellations.
	+ For beginners: Think of this system like managing a physical parking lot where cars come and go. You need to ensure that there are enough spots available and keep track of who is parked where.
	+ For advanced developers: Consider how you would optimize the system for performance, handling high volumes of requests while minimizing conflicts between multiple users.
* **Library System**: Envision designing a library management system that keeps track of books, authors, and borrowers. You need to manage checkouts, returns, and book recommendations.
	+ For beginners: Picture this system like organizing a personal book collection where you keep track of what's available and who has borrowed which books.
	+ For advanced developers: Think about how you would implement search functionality, handle multiple libraries with shared collections, or integrate with other systems (e.g., cataloging software).
* **Composition**: Composition is the process of combining objects to form a new entity. In our examples, the parking lot and library systems are composed of individual objects like cars, books, and borrowers.
	+ For beginners: Understand that composition allows you to build complex systems by combining simpler ones. This can help simplify code and reduce redundancy.
	+ For advanced developers: Consider how you would optimize object creation and garbage collection, ensuring efficient memory usage and minimizing performance impacts.

## Practical Examples

Here are three Java code examples demonstrating the application of OOP design principles:

```java
// Parking Lot System Example (simplified)
class ParkingSpot {
    private boolean occupied;
    public void occupy() { occupied = true; }
    public void vacate() { occupied = false; }
}

class ParkingLot {
    private List spots;

    public ParkingLot(int numSpots) {
        spots = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numSpots; i++) {
            spots.add(new ParkingSpot());
        }
    }

    public void park(Car car) {
        // find available spot and mark it occupied
    }
}

// Library System Example (simplified)
class Book {
    private String title;
    private Author author;

    public Book(String title, Author author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
}

class Library {
    private List books;

    public Library() {
        books = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    }

    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book);
    }
}
```

Beginners can follow the code step-by-step, focusing on how each class represents an object and interacts with others. Advanced developers can discuss real-world applications (e.g., integrating with a cataloging system or handling multiple libraries).

## Diagrams

No diagrams are required for this topic.

## Best Practices

Here are three best practices to keep in mind when applying OOP design principles:

* **Encapsulate sensitive data**: Use private variables and getter/setter methods to control access to critical information.
	+ For beginners: Think of encapsulation like keeping your personal belongings secure. You don't want others accessing or modifying them without permission.
	+ For advanced developers: This practice helps prevent unauthorized changes and ensures data integrity.
* **Use composition effectively**: Combine objects to form new entities, but avoid over-engineering by keeping the number of components manageable.
	+ For beginners: Understand that composition can simplify code and reduce redundancy. However, be mindful of performance impacts and complexity.
	+ For advanced developers: Consider how you would optimize object creation and garbage collection, ensuring efficient memory usage and minimizing performance impacts.
* **Follow SOLID principles**: Design your systems according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open-Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
	+ For beginners: Think of SOLID principles like building a strong foundation for your software. Each principle helps ensure that your code is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.
	+ For advanced developers: These principles help you create robust systems that can adapt to changing requirements and handle complexity.
