# Java Modules (JPMS) - advanced-java-modules

## Introduction

As a Java developer, you're likely familiar with the concept of modularity in programming. The ability to break down large applications into smaller, independent modules is crucial for maintainability and scalability. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, provides a standardized way to create and manage these modules. This topic is essential for any Java developer looking to take their skills to the next level.

For beginners, imagine building with LEGOs - each module is like a single brick that can be easily added or removed from your application without affecting its overall structure. For advanced developers, think of JPMS as a way to standardize and streamline your codebase, making it easier to collaborate with others and integrate third-party libraries.

## Prerequisites

To understand Java modules, you should have:

* Basic knowledge of Java programming
* Familiarity with the concept of modularity in software development
* Experience with Maven or Gradle for building and managing Java projects (optional)

For beginners: Maven and Gradle are popular build tools that help manage dependencies and compile your code. Think of them as a set of instructions on how to assemble your LEGOs!

## Key Concepts

Here are the core concepts you'll need to understand:

* **Modules**: A module is a self-contained piece of code that can be used independently.
	+ Beginners: Imagine a single Lego brick that can be added or removed from your application. Each module has its own dependencies and exports specific classes and interfaces.
	+ Advanced: JPMS uses a module-info.class file to declare the module's name, version, and dependencies. This file is generated automatically when you create a Java module.
* **Dependencies**: A module can depend on other modules or libraries.
	+ Beginners: Think of dependencies as the instructions on how to use your Lego brick in combination with other bricks.
	+ Advanced: JPMS uses a service loader mechanism to manage dependencies between modules. This allows for explicit control over which modules are loaded and when.
* **Services**: A module can provide services that can be used by other modules or applications.
	+ Beginners: Imagine a service as a specific function that your Lego brick provides, like being able to connect to other bricks in a special way.
	+ Advanced: JPMS uses a service registry to manage the discovery and binding of services. This enables loose coupling between modules and makes it easier to swap out implementations.

## Practical Examples

Here are some code examples to help you get started:

### Example 1: Simple Module
```java
// mymodule/module-info.java
module mymodule {
    exports com.example;
}

// mymodule/com/example/MyService.java
public class MyService {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyService!");
    }
}
```
Beginners: This example shows how to create a simple Java module that exports a single class. Think of this as building a single Lego brick with a specific function.

Advanced: Note the use of the `module-info.class` file to declare the module's name and exports. This is automatically generated by the Java compiler when you create a Java module.

### Example 2: Dependency Management
```java
// dependency-mgmt/module1/module-info.java
module module1 {
    requires mymodule;
}

// dependency-mgmt/com/example/MyServiceClient.java
public class MyServiceClient {
    public void useMyService() {
        mymule.MyService service = ServiceLoader.load(MyService.class).get(0);
        service.doSomething();
    }
}
```
Beginners: This example shows how to declare a dependency between two modules. Think of this as building a Lego brick that depends on another specific brick.

Advanced: Note the use of the `requires` keyword in the module-info file to specify the dependency. The `ServiceLoader.load()` method is used to load the service instance at runtime.

### Example 3: Service Registration
```java
// service-registrar/module2/module-info.java
module module2 {
    provides com.example.MyService with mymule.MyServiceImpl;
}

// service-registrar/com/example/MyServiceImpl.java
public class MyServiceImpl implements com.example.MyService {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyServiceImpl!");
    }
}
```
Beginners: This example shows how to register a service implementation. Think of this as building a Lego brick that provides a specific function.

Advanced: Note the use of the `provides` keyword in the module-info file to declare the service registration. The service instance is created and registered at runtime using the `ServiceLoader.load()` method.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

* **Use clear and concise module names**: This will make it easier to understand the purpose of each module.
	+ Beginners: Think of a clear module name as a label on your Lego brick that describes its function.
	+ Advanced: Clear module names can help with dependency management and service discovery.
* **Keep modules small and focused**: This will make it easier to manage dependencies and maintain your codebase.
	+ Beginners: Imagine building a single Lego brick that has a specific function, rather than trying to build an entire castle in one piece.
	+ Advanced: Smaller modules can lead to better modularity and scalability.
* **Use service registration for loose coupling**: This will enable you to swap out implementations without affecting the rest of your application.
	+ Beginners: Think of service registration as a way to connect different Lego bricks together, without affecting their individual functions.
	+ Advanced: Service registration enables loose coupling between modules, making it easier to maintain and extend your codebase.

## Further Reading

If you want to learn more about Java modules, I recommend checking out the following resources:

* **Oracle's Java Platform Module System Documentation**: This is a comprehensive resource that covers all aspects of JPMS.
* **Java 9: The Definitive Guide**: This book provides in-depth coverage of Java 9 features, including JPMS.
* **"Java Modules: A New Era for Java Development" by Oracle Developer Advocate, John Yeary**: This article provides an introduction to JPMS and its benefits.

I hope this helps you get started with Java modules!
