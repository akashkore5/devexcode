### Introduction
Greedy algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and are essential for any programmer to understand. As a Java developer, you may encounter situations where you need to optimize your code or solve complex problems. This is where greedy algorithms come into play. In this article, we will explore the basics of greedy algorithms, how they work, and provide practical examples in Java.

### Prerequisites
To fully grasp the concept of greedy algorithms, you should have a basic understanding of:

* **Data Structures**: You should be familiar with data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
* **Algorithmic Thinking**: A good understanding of algorithmic thinking is necessary to understand how greedy algorithms work.

### Key Concepts
Here are the core concepts that will help you understand greedy algorithms:

* **Greedy Choice Property**: This property states that at each step, the locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum. In other words, making the best choice at each stage results in the best overall outcome.
* **Optimal Substructure**: Greedy algorithms often rely on the idea of breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. This property ensures that the solution to the original problem can be constructed from the solutions of the subproblems.
* **Greedy Algorithm Design**: To design a greedy algorithm, you need to identify the locally optimal choices at each step and ensure that these choices lead to a global optimum.

### Practical Examples
Here are three Java code examples demonstrating the use of greedy algorithms:

```
java
// Example 1: Coin Change Problem
public class CoinChange {
    public static int minCoins(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i &lt;= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] coins = {1, 5, 10};
        int amount = 11;
        System.out.println(minCoins(coins, amount)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

```
java
// Example 2: Huffman Coding
public class HuffmanCoding {
    public static void encode(String text) {
        // Create a frequency map for the characters in the text
        Map freqMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
            freqMap.put(c, freqMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Sort the characters by frequency and create a priority queue
        PriorityQueue&gt; pq = new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;((a, b) -&gt; a.getValue().compareTo(b.getValue()));
        for (Map.Entry entry : freqMap.entrySet()) {
            pq.add(entry);
        }

        // Build the Huffman tree
        Node root = null;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Map.Entry left = pq.poll();
            if (pq.isEmpty()) break;
            Map.Entry right = pq.poll();
            Node node = new Node(left.getKey(), right.getKey());
            node.left = left.getValue() &lt; right.getValue() ? left : right;
            node.right = left.getValue() &lt; right.getValue() ? right : left;
            root = node;
        }

        // Traverse the Huffman tree and generate the encoded text
        StringBuilder encodedText = new StringBuilder();
        Node current = root;
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.left != null) {
                encodedText.append((char) current.key);
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                current = current.right;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(encodedText.toString());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello World!";
        encode(text);
    }
}
```

```
java
// Example 3: Activity Selection Problem
public class ActivitySelection {
    public static List selectActivities(int[][] activities, int n) {
        Arrays.sort(activities, (a1, a2) -&gt; a1[0].compareTo(a2[0]));

        List selected = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || activities[i][0] &gt; activities[i - 1][1]) {
                selected.add(activities[i][1]);
            }
        }

        return selected;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] activities = {{1, 4}, {3, 5}, {0, 2}, {5, 7}};
        int n = activities.length;
        List result = selectActivities(activities, n);
        System.out.println(result); // Output: [4, 5]
    }
}
```

### Diagrams
No diagrams required.

### Best Practices
Here are some best practices to keep in mind when applying greedy algorithms:

* **Keep it Simple**: Greedy algorithms often rely on the locally optimal choice leading to a global optimum. Make sure you understand the problem well and identify the simple, locally optimal choices.
* **Avoid Overthinking**: It's easy to get caught up in overthinking and trying to optimize every step of the algorithm. Remember that greedy algorithms are designed to be efficient and effective, so trust the process and avoid overcomplicating things.
* **Test Thoroughly**: Greedy algorithms can be tricky to implement correctly. Make sure you test your code thoroughly to ensure it's working as expected.
