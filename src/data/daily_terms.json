It works like an electrical circuit breaker: if a service fails repeatedly, the circuit breaker 'trips' and stops sending requests to that service for a set period, allowing it to recover. During this time, fallback logic (e.g., returning cached data) can be executed. This pattern improves system resilience but requires careful tuning of thresholds and timeouts."

In software, this might involve allocating separate thread pools or resources for different services or operations. For example, if one microservice fails, others can continue functioning because they don’t share the same resources. This enhances fault tolerance but can increase resource usage and complexity."

For example, in JavaScript, composing a function to uppercase a string and then trim it might look like compose(trim, uppercase). Function composition promotes modularity and reusability, but it can make debugging harder due to the chained execution."

For example, using RxJS in JavaScript, an app might react to user clicks as a stream, transforming and combining them with other streams (e.g., API responses). Reactive programming simplifies event-driven systems, like real-time apps, but it has a steep learning curve and can lead to complex code if streams are overused."

For example, in Java, a Stream API can process a list of numbers (e.g., filtering even numbers), while in RxJS, a stream might represent user clicks over time. Streams enable efficient, declarative data processing, but they require careful management of backpressure and resource usage in high-volume scenarios."

For example, in a streaming app, if a server sends events too quickly, the client might buffer excessively. Backpressure is managed by strategies like buffering, dropping, or throttling, ensuring system stability, but it requires careful tuning to balance throughput and resource usage."
