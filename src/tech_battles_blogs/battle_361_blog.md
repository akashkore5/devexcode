# Typo3 vs. eZ Publish: Enterprise CMS Platforms
## Introduction

As developers, choosing the right Content Management System (CMS) is crucial for building a scalable and customizable solution for our clients. Two popular options in this regard are Typo3 and eZ Publish. Both have been around for over two decades, with Typo3 having its roots dating back to 1998 and eZ Publish being founded in 2000.
