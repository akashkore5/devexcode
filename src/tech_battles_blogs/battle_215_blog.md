# Jooby vs. Helidon: Micro Java Frameworks
## Introduction
In recent years, microservices have become increasingly popular in software development, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in large-scale applications. Two micro Java frameworks that have gained attention are Jooby and Helidon. Both aim to simplify the development of microservices by providing a robust set of features and tools. In this article, we'll compare Jooby and Helidon, focusing on their performance, ease of use, scalability, and ecosystem.

## Key Comparison Points
### Performance
Jooby is designed with performance in mind. It uses a non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle requests efficiently. Jooby's performance is comparable to that of Helidon, but it can be improved by using the async API. In benchmarks, Jooby demonstrated 10% better performance than Helidon. However, this advantage may not translate to real-world applications.

### Scalability
Both Jooby and Helidon are designed to handle increased load and complexity. They support clustering, which allows multiple instances of a service to be run in parallel, improving overall performance and scalability. Jooby's clustering model is more straightforward, while Helidon requires additional configuration.

### Ease of Use
Jooby has a relatively steep learning curve due to its complex architecture and numerous features. While the framework provides good documentation, it can take time for developers to become proficient. Helidon, on the other hand, is designed with ease of use in mind. Its API is simpler, and the framework provides more comprehensive documentation.

### Ecosystem
Both Jooby and Helidon have growing ecosystems, with a variety of libraries and tools available. However, Jooby's ecosystem is more extensive, with support for popular frameworks like Spark and Dropwizard. Helidon's ecosystem is still developing but has the backing of Oracle, which can provide additional resources and support.

## Pros and Cons

3. **Limited support**: While Jooby has a growing ecosystem, its community is still developing.

### Helidon
**Pros**

1. **High-performance**: Helidon's performance is comparable to that of Jooby.
2. **Ease of use**: Helidon's API is simpler, making it easier for developers to learn and use.
3. **Growing ecosystem**: Helidon has the backing of Oracle, which can provide additional resources and support.
4. **Robust documentation**: Helidon provides comprehensive documentation for developers.

5. **Simplified clustering model**: Helidon's clustering model is more straightforward than Jooby's.

**Cons**

1. **Limited libraries**: Helidon's ecosystem is still developing, with fewer libraries and tools available.
2. **Complex configuration**: Helidon requires additional configuration for clustering.
3. **Less robust testing framework**: Helidon's testing framework is less comprehensive than Jooby's.
