# Scully vs. Elder.js: Angular/JAMstack Generators
## Introduction
As the demand for fast, secure, and scalable web applications continues to grow, developers are increasingly turning to JAMstack generators like Scully and Elder.js to streamline their development workflows. In this comparison, we'll delve into the features, performance, and ecosystems of these two popular tools to help you decide which one best fits your project needs.

Scully is an Angular-based static site generator that leverages the power of Webpack and Babel to generate fast, SEO-friendly websites. Originally designed for Angular applications, Scully has since expanded to support other frameworks like React and Vue.js. Elder.js, on the other hand, is a lightweight, TypeScript-based SSG built specifically for Angular and JAMstack applications.

## Key Comparison Points

### Performance
When it comes to performance, both Scully and Elder.js excel in generating fast, SEO-friendly websites. However, Elder.js has a slight edge in terms of raw speed, thanks to its lean architecture and optimized build process. According to benchmarks, Elder.js can generate sites up to 30% faster than Scully.

### Scalability
Both tools demonstrate excellent scalability, handling increased loads and complexity with ease. Scully's modular architecture allows it to handle large-scale projects, while Elder.js's lightweight design makes it ideal for smaller projects or those requiring high-performance optimization.

### Ease of Use
While both tools have a relatively low learning curve, Elder.js is generally considered more user-friendly, thanks to its intuitive API and extensive documentation. Scully, on the other hand, requires a bit more setup and configuration, but still offers a comprehensive learning experience through its official tutorials and community resources.

### Ecosystem
When it comes to ecosystem support, Scully has a clear advantage, boasting an extensive library of plugins and integrations with popular tools like Webpack, Babel, and Rollup. Elder.js, while still young, is rapidly gaining traction, with growing communities and increasing adoption rates.

## Pros and Cons
