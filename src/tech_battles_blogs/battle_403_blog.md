# Strapi vs. Sanity: Headless CMS Platforms
## Introduction

In recent years, headless Content Management Systems (CMS) have gained popularity due to their flexibility and scalability. Two prominent players in this space are Strapi and Sanity. As developers seeking a robust and efficient headless CMS solution, it's essential to evaluate these platforms based on key metrics such as performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem.

Strapi is an open-source, Node.js-based headless CMS that provides a flexible and customizable architecture for building web applications. Founded in 2016 by Guillermo Rauch, Strapi has gained popularity due to its ease of use, scalability, and robust feature set.

Sanity, on the other hand, is a headless CMS developed by Sanity.io, a company founded in 2013 by developers who were frustrated with traditional CMS limitations. Sanity focuses on providing a flexible and modular architecture for building web applications, emphasizing developer experience and ecosystem integration.

This article will provide an in-depth comparison of Strapi and Sanity, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses as headless CMS platforms. We'll evaluate these platforms based on key metrics such as performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem.

## Key Comparison Points
