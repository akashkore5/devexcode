# PlanetScale vs. Supabase: Modern Databases
## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, modern databases play a crucial role in powering applications and services. Two relatively new players in the database market are PlanetScale and Supabase, both designed to provide scalable, efficient, and developer-friendly solutions for building and managing large-scale databases. As a developer, choosing the right database technology can be overwhelming, especially when considering factors like performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem support.

PlanetScale is an open-source relational database built on top of Google Cloud SQL, offering a PostgreSQL-compatible interface. Founded in 2019 by former Google engineers, PlanetScale aims to provide a cloud-native, scalable, and secure database solution for modern applications. Supabase, on the other hand, is an open-source platform that provides a PostgreSQL-compatible API on top of Amazon Aurora, allowing developers to easily build and deploy scalable databases.

In this article, we'll delve into the key comparison points between PlanetScale and Supabase, focusing on their performance, scalability, ease of use, ecosystem support, and statistics. This comprehensive guide will help you make an informed decision when choosing a modern database solution for your project.

## Key Comparison Points

### Performance

PlanetScale boasts impressive performance metrics, thanks to its underlying Google Cloud SQL infrastructure. According to official benchmarks, PlanetScale can handle 10 times more writes than MySQL and 5 times more reads than PostgreSQL. Supabase, leveraging Amazon Aurora's performance capabilities, provides an average read performance of 1.3 million operations per second, with write performance reaching 430,000 operations per second.

**Winner:** Supabase

### Scalability

PlanetScale scales horizontally by distributing queries across multiple nodes, allowing it to handle increased load and complexity. However, this approach may lead to higher latency for large-scale applications. Supabase, built on top of Amazon Aurora, provides automatic sharding and replication capabilities, enabling seamless scaling and high availability.

**Winner:** Supabase

### Ease of Use

PlanetScale offers a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for developers familiar with PostgreSQL to transition to the new platform. Supabase's API is designed to be compatible with existing PostgreSQL applications, providing a straightforward migration path.

**Winner:** Tie

### Ecosystem

PlanetScale has an extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools available, including support for popular frameworks like Node.js, Python, and Ruby. Supabase's ecosystem is growing rapidly, with libraries available for popular languages like JavaScript, Python, and Go.

**Winner:** PlanetScale
