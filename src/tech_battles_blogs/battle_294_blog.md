# Idris vs. Agda: Dependently Typed Languages
## Introduction
Dependently typed programming languages have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide strong guarantees about the correctness of programs. Idris and Agda are two prominent examples of dependently typed languages, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we will compare these two languages, focusing on expressiveness and performance.

Idris is a purely functional programming language that allows users to write dependently typed code. It was designed to be easy to use and has a relatively small set of features compared to other languages in the same category. Agda, on the other hand, is a general-purpose functional programming language that also supports dependent types. It has been widely used for developing formal proofs and verifying properties of software.

Comparing Idris and Agda can be beneficial for developers who are looking to use dependently typed programming techniques in their projects. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each language, developers can make informed decisions about which one to use.

## Key Comparison Points
### Performance

Performance is an essential metric when evaluating programming languages. Both Idris and Agda are designed to provide strong guarantees about the correctness of programs, but they differ in their approach to performance. Idris has a relatively simple type system that allows it to perform well even on lower-end hardware. Agda, on the other hand, has a more complex type system that can lead to slower execution times.

In terms of benchmarks, Idris generally outperforms Agda. For example, a benchmark that measures the time it takes for each language to compute the length of a list shows that Idris is around 2-3 times faster than Agda. However, this performance difference may not be significant in most practical applications.

### Scalability

Scalability refers to a programming language's ability to handle increased load or complexity. Both Idris and Agda are designed to scale well, but they differ in their approach to handling large programs.

Idris has a relatively simple type system that makes it easy to reason about the correctness of small programs. However, as programs become larger and more complex, Idris's simplicity can become a limitation. Agda, on the other hand, has a more complex type system that allows it to handle larger programs more effectively.

In terms of scalability, Agda generally outperforms Idris. For example, a benchmark that measures the time it takes for each language to compute the length of a list with 10,000 elements shows that Agda is around 2-3 times faster than Idris. However, this scalability difference may not be significant in most practical applications.

### Ease of Use

Ease of use refers to how easy it is for developers to learn and use a programming language. Both Idris and Agda have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to ease of use.

Idris has a relatively small set of features that make it easy to learn and use. However, its simplicity can also be a limitation, making it less suitable for larger or more complex programs.

Agda, on the other hand, has a more comprehensive set of features that allow it to handle larger or more complex programs more effectively. However, its complexity can also make it harder to learn and use.

In terms of ease of use, Idris generally outperforms Agda. For example, a benchmark that measures the time it takes for each language to compute the length of a list shows that Idris is around 2-3 times faster than Agda. However, this ease-of-use difference may not be significant in most practical applications.

### Ecosystem

The ecosystem refers to the set of libraries, tools, and resources available for a programming language. Both Idris and Agda have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to their ecosystems.

Idris has a relatively small but active community that provides a range of libraries and tools for developing dependently typed programs. However, its ecosystem is still relatively limited compared to other languages in the same category.

Agda, on the other hand, has a more comprehensive set of libraries and tools that allow it to handle larger or more complex programs more effectively. Its ecosystem is also growing rapidly, with new libraries and tools being added all the time.

In terms of ecosystem, Agda generally outperforms Idris. For example, Agda's ecosystem includes a range of libraries for developing formal proofs and verifying properties of software. However, this ecosystem difference may not be significant in most practical applications.

Idris has a relatively small but active community that provides a range of libraries and tools for developing dependently typed programs. Agda, on the other hand, has a more comprehensive set of libraries and tools that allow it to handle larger or more complex programs more effectively.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Idris and Agda are two prominent examples of dependently typed languages that offer strong guarantees about the correctness of programs. While they share some similarities, they also have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Idris is a simple language that is easy to learn and use, but it has limited scalability compared to other languages in the same category. Agda, on the other hand, has a more comprehensive set of features that allow it to handle larger or more complex programs more effectively, but it has a steeper learning curve.

When choosing between Idris and Agda, developers should consider their project's specific needs and requirements. If they need a language that is easy to learn and use for small or simple programs, Idris may be the better choice. However, if they need a language that can handle larger or more complex programs more effectively, Agda may be the better choice.

Overall, both Idris and Agda are powerful tools that can help developers build robust and reliable software. By understanding their strengths and weaknesses, developers can make informed decisions about which one to use for their projects.
