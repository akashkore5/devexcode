# OpenFaaS vs. OpenWhisk: Serverless Platforms
## Introduction

In recent years, serverless computing has gained significant attention in the tech industry. Two prominent open-source platforms, OpenFaaS and OpenWhisk, have emerged as popular choices for building scalable, cost-effective, and efficient applications. As a developer, it's essential to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each platform to make informed decisions about which one to use for your project.

OpenFaaS (Functions-as-a-Service) is an open-source framework that enables developers to build serverless applications using Docker containers. OpenWhisk, on the other hand, is a cloud-native event-driven programming model developed by Apache Software Foundation. Both platforms aim to simplify the process of building scalable and efficient applications, but they differ in their architecture, scalability, and ease of use.

This article compares OpenFaaS and OpenWhisk, focusing on performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem. We'll also provide insights into adoption rates, community size, and use cases for each platform.

## Key Comparison Points

### Performance

OpenFaaS relies on Docker containers to manage functions, which provides a high level of isolation and scalability. OpenWhisk, on the other hand, uses an event-driven programming model that allows for highly concurrent processing. In terms of performance, both platforms can handle a large number of requests concurrently. However, OpenWhisk's event-driven architecture makes it better suited for handling bursty workloads or sudden spikes in traffic.

**OpenFaaS**: High scalability and flexibility due to Docker containerization
**OpenWhisk**: Very high scalability and concurrency support

### Scalability

Both platforms can handle increased load and complexity, but they approach scalability differently. OpenFaaS relies on horizontal scaling through additional containers or instances, whereas OpenWhisk uses a distributed architecture that allows it to scale horizontally by adding more nodes.

**OpenFaaS**: Moderate scalability with horizontal scaling
**OpenWhisk**: High scalability with distributed architecture

### Ease of Use

OpenFaaS provides a simpler learning curve due to its Docker-based approach and Python SDK. OpenWhisk, while still relatively easy to learn, requires a stronger understanding of event-driven programming and Apache Beam.

**OpenFaaS**: Moderate ease of use with Python SDK
**OpenWhisk**: High ease of use for those familiar with event-driven programming

### Ecosystem

Both platforms have active communities and provide a wide range of libraries and tools. OpenFaaS has a more extensive ecosystem, including integrations with popular cloud providers like AWS and Azure.

**OpenFaaS**: Extensive ecosystem with many integrations
**OpenWhisk**: Growing ecosystem with strong Apache backing

## Pros and Cons

### OpenFaaS

Pros:

1. **High scalability**: OpenFaaS can handle a large number of requests concurrently.
2. **Flexibility**: Docker containerization provides flexibility in terms of function deployment and management.
3. **Extensive ecosystem**: OpenFaaS has a wide range of libraries, tools, and integrations with popular cloud providers.
4. **Easy to learn**: Python SDK makes it easier for developers to get started.

Cons:

1. **Steep learning curve for Docker**: While OpenFaaS simplifies the process, some developers may need time to adapt to Docker containerization.
2. **Limited support for serverless functions**: OpenFaaS is not specifically designed for serverless computing and may not provide the same level of abstraction as dedicated serverless platforms.

### OpenWhisk

Pros:

1. **High scalability**: OpenWhisk's distributed architecture allows it to scale horizontally by adding more nodes.
2. **Easy to learn**: Event-driven programming model makes it easier for developers familiar with Apache Beam to get started.
3. **Strong community support**: OpenWhisk has a strong backing from the Apache Software Foundation and an active community.
4. **Growing ecosystem**: OpenWhisk's ecosystem is growing, with new libraries and tools being developed.

Cons:

1. **Steeper learning curve for event-driven programming**: Developers may need to adapt to a new programming model and terminology.
2. **Limited support for Docker integration**: While OpenWhisk supports Docker, it's not as extensive as OpenFaaS' ecosystem.

## Statistics and Insights

According to the 2020 State of Serverless Report, OpenFaaS has around 3,500 users, while OpenWhisk has around 1,800. In terms of adoption rates, both platforms are growing, with OpenFaaS seeing a 25% increase in user base over the past year.

Here's an ASCII table comparing OpenFaaS and OpenWhisk on Performance, Scalability, Ease of Use, and Ecosystem:

```
| Metric        | OpenFaaS       | OpenWhisk       |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Performance   | High          | Very High     |
| Scalability   | Moderate      | High          |
| Ease of Use   | Moderate      | High          |
| Ecosystem     | Extensive     | Growing       |
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both OpenFaaS and OpenWhisk are powerful serverless platforms that cater to different needs. When choosing between the two, consider the following:

* If you're looking for a platform with high scalability and flexibility, OpenFaaS might be the better choice.
* If you prefer an event-driven programming model and strong community support, OpenWhisk could be the way to go.

Ultimately, the decision comes down to your project's specific requirements and your team's expertise. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, you can make an informed decision that meets your needs and helps you build scalable and efficient applications.
