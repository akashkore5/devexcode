# Neon vs. EdgeDB: Modern Relational Databases
## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world of software development, choosing the right technology stack can make all the difference in meeting project goals and timelines. Two modern relational databases that have gained significant attention are Neon and EdgeDB. Both aim to simplify data storage and provide a seamless experience for developers. This article will delve into the key comparison points between Neon and EdgeDB, focusing on developer experience and scalability.

Neon is an open-source, cloud-native relational database designed specifically for the modern application stack. With its roots in PostgreSQL, Neon offers a unique blend of speed, scalability, and ease of use. EdgeDB, on the other hand, is a graph-based relational database that combines the power of graphs with the simplicity of SQL.

In this comparison, we will explore the performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem of both databases to help developers make an informed decision for their next project.
