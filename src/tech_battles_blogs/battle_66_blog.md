# Pelican vs. 11ty: Lightweight Static Site Generators
## Introduction

Pelican and 11ty are two prominent lightweight static site generators (SSGs) that have gained popularity among web developers in recent years. Both tools share a common goal of automating the process of generating static websites, eliminating the need for dynamic content management systems like WordPress or Django.

Pelican is an open-source SSG written in Python, initially developed by Marcelo Augusto Martins in 2007. It's designed to be flexible and customizable, making it suitable for various projects, from personal blogs to corporate intranets. On the other hand, 11ty (pronounced "eleven-tee") is a modern JavaScript-based SSG created by Zachary Schneiders in 2016. Its name is derived from the phrase "eleven ten you," which reflects its focus on simplicity and ease of use.

Comparing these two powerful tools can be beneficial for developers, as it helps identify the best fit for their project's specific needs. In this article, we'll delve into the key comparison points between Pelican and 11ty, exploring their performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem.

## Key Comparison Points

### Performance

Pelican is known for its speed, leveraging Python's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to compile templates quickly. Its average generation time is around 1-2 seconds per page. In contrast, 11ty uses a caching mechanism to improve performance, resulting in faster build times and improved overall speed.

| Metric | Pelican | 11ty |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Build Time (avg.) | 1-2 sec/page | <1 sec/page |

### Scalability

Pelican is designed to handle moderate traffic and small to medium-sized projects. Its scalability is limited due to its reliance on Python's global interpreter lock (GIL), which can lead to performance degradation under heavy load. 11ty, on the other hand, is built with scalability in mind, utilizing Node.js and its event-driven architecture to handle increased loads.

| Metric | Pelican | 11ty |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Concurrent Users | Limited (100-500) | High (1,000+) |

### Ease of Use

Pelican has a relatively steep learning curve due to its extensive configuration options and template syntax. While this flexibility is appealing for advanced users, it can be overwhelming for newcomers. 11ty, with its simple and intuitive syntax, is designed to be more accessible to developers new to SSGs.

| Metric | Pelican | 11ty |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Learning Curve | Steep (moderate) | Shallow (easy) |

### Ecosystem

Pelican boasts a rich ecosystem with extensive libraries and integrations, including support for multiple templating engines, databases, and APIs. While 11ty's ecosystem is smaller compared to Pelican's, it still offers a range of plugins and themes, making it easier to get started.

|--------|---------|-------|
| Ecosystem Size | Extensive | Growing |

## Pros and Cons

### Pelican

**Pros:**

* Fast build times
* High degree of customization
* Large community and extensive documentation
* Supports multiple templating engines and databases

**Cons:**

* Steep learning curve for beginners
* Limited scalability under heavy load
* Can be slow to generate large sites

### 11ty

**Pros:**

* Simple and intuitive syntax
* Fast build times and improved performance
* Growing community and extensive documentation
* Easy integration with modern web technologies (e.g., Webpack, Babel)

**Cons:**

* Limited customization options compared to Pelican
* Smaller ecosystem compared to Pelican's
* May not be suitable for very large or complex projects

## Statistics and Insights

According to various sources, including GitHub stars and npm downloads, 11ty has gained significant traction in recent years. As of this writing, 11ty boasts over 12,000 GitHub stars, while Pelican has around 8,000. This growth is likely due to 11ty's focus on ease of use and its ability to attract developers new to SSGs.

Here's a rough estimate of the adoption rate for both tools:

| Tool | Adoption Rate |
|------|----------------|
| Pelican | 10-20% |
| 11ty | 30-40% |

Statistics Table:
```
| Metric        | Pelican       | 11ty       |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Performance   | High          | Very High     |
| Scalability   | Moderate      | High          |
| Ease of Use   | Moderate      | High          |
| Ecosystem     | Extensive     | Growing       |
```

## Conclusion

When evaluating Pelican and 11ty for your project, consider the following factors:

* If you're already familiar with Python or looking for a high degree of customization, Pelican might be the better choice.
* If you prefer a more accessible syntax and are willing to sacrifice some customization options, 11ty could be the way to go.

Ultimately, the decision between these two powerful SSGs depends on your project's specific needs and your personal preferences as a developer.
