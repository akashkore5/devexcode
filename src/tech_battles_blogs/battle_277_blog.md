# Strider vs. Screwdriver: CI/CD Platforms
## Introduction
Comparing Strider and Screwdriver for CI/CD workflows, analyzing scalability and ease of use. Both platforms have gained popularity among developers due to their ability to streamline continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes. In this article, we will delve into the key features, pros, and cons of each platform to help you decide which one suits your project needs.

Strider is an open-source CI/CD platform that emerged in 2014 as a response to the growing demand for automated testing and deployment tools. Screwdriver, on the other hand, is a cloud-native CI/CD platform that debuted in 2017 with a focus on scalability and ease of use. By comparing these two platforms, we can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses, helping developers make informed decisions about which tool to use for their projects.
