# ReasonML vs. ReScript: Functional JavaScript Alternatives
## Introduction

In recent years, functional programming has gained popularity among developers due to its benefits in terms of scalability, maintainability, and error prevention. Two notable languages that have emerged as alternatives to traditional JavaScript for building scalable and maintainable applications are ReasonML and ReScript. Both languages share a common goal: to provide type safety and performance improvements for JavaScript developers.

ReasonML is a statically typed programming language developed by Facebook in 2016. It compiles to JavaScript, making it an attractive choice for web development. ReasonML's strong focus on functional programming and its ability to leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks make it an appealing option for developers looking to build scalable applications.

ReScript, on the other hand, is a statically typed programming language developed by Facebook in 2019. It shares many similarities with ReasonML but has some key differences. ReScript is designed specifically for building web applications and provides better performance, scalability, and security compared to ReasonML. Its strong focus on functional programming, type safety, and its ability to generate fast and efficient JavaScript code make it an attractive choice for developers looking to build high-performance web applications.

Comparing ReasonML and ReScript for functional JavaScript development is relevant because both languages offer unique benefits that can be leveraged by developers to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performing applications. This article will provide a detailed comparison of the two languages, focusing on type safety, performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem.

## Key Comparison Points

### Performance

Both ReasonML and ReScript are designed to provide better performance compared to traditional JavaScript development. ReasonML compiles to JavaScript, which means that it can leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks while still providing the benefits of type safety and functional programming. However, ReasonML's compilation process can introduce some overhead, which may affect performance in certain situations.

ReScript, on the other hand, is designed specifically for building web applications and provides better performance compared to ReasonML. Its strong focus on generating fast and efficient JavaScript code makes it an attractive choice for developers looking to build high-performance web applications. ReScript's performance is comparable to that of JavaScript itself, making it a viable option for building complex web applications.

In terms of benchmarks, ReasonML scores around 10,000-15,000 operations per second (ops/sec), while ReScript scores around 20,000-30,000 ops/sec. While there may be some overhead introduced by ReasonML's compilation process, the difference in performance between the two languages is relatively small.

### Scalability

Both ReasonML and ReScript are designed to provide better scalability compared to traditional JavaScript development. ReasonML's strong focus on functional programming and its ability to leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks make it an attractive option for building scalable applications.
