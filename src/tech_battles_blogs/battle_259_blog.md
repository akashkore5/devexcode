# Fastly vs. KeyCDN: Content Delivery Networks
## Introduction

As the demand for fast and reliable online content delivery continues to grow, developers are faced with a multitude of options when it comes to choosing a content delivery network (CDN). Two prominent players in this space are Fastly and KeyCDN, each offering unique features and benefits. In this article, we'll delve into the key differences between these two CDNs, examining their performance, scalability, ease of use, and ecosystem.

Fastly is a well-established CDN with over 10 years of experience in delivering fast and secure online content. Founded in 2007, Fastly has built a reputation for its high-performance edge network and robust security features. KeyCDN, on the other hand, is a relatively newer player in the market, founded in 2013. Despite this, KeyCDN has quickly gained traction due to its aggressive pricing and ease of use.

Evaluating Fastly and KeyCDN for content delivery, comparing performance and pricing, is crucial for developers looking to optimize their online presence. In the following sections, we'll explore the key differences between these two CDNs, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

## Key Comparison Points

### Performance

Fastly's edge network is built on a robust infrastructure that can handle even the most demanding workloads. With an average latency of 40ms, Fastly offers fast content delivery across its global network of over 60 PoPs (Points of Presence). KeyCDN also boasts impressive performance, with an average latency of 30ms and a global network spanning over 25 PoPs. However, Fastly's sheer scale and experience give it a slight edge in terms of overall performance.

### Scalability

Both CDNs have demonstrated the ability to handle increased load or complexity, making them suitable for large-scale applications. Fastly has shown impressive scalability, handling traffic spikes of up to 100x without a hiccup. KeyCDN has also demonstrated robust scalability, handling traffic increases of up to 50x with ease. However, Fastly's experience and sheer scale give it an edge in terms of long-term sustainability.

### Ease of Use

Fastly offers a more complex setup process due to its advanced feature set and customization options. While this can be beneficial for developers who require fine-grained control, it may present a steeper learning curve for those new to CDNs. KeyCDN, on the other hand, is designed with ease of use in mind, offering a user-friendly interface and straightforward setup process. This makes it an attractive option for developers looking for a hassle-free CDN experience.

### Ecosystem

Fastly boasts an extensive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and integrations, making it a popular choice among developers. Its extensive documentation and community support also make it easier to find solutions and troubleshoot issues. KeyCDN's ecosystem is still growing but has made significant strides in recent years. While it may not offer the same level of integration as Fastly, its community support and documentation are improving rapidly.
